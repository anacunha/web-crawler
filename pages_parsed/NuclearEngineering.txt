nuclear engineering nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of the breakdown fission as well as the fusion of atomic nuclei andor the application of other sub-atomic physics based on the principles of nuclear physics in the sub-field of nuclear fission it particularly includes the interaction and maintenance of systems and components like nuclear reactors nuclear power plants andor nuclear weapons the field also includes the study of medical and other applications of generally ionizing radiation nuclear safety heatthermodynamics transport nuclear fuel andor other related technology eg radioactive waste disposal and the problems of nuclear proliferation professional areas the united states generates about 18% of its electricity from nuclear power plants nuclear engineers in this field generally work directly or indirectly in the nuclear power industry or for national laboratories current research in the industry is directed at producing economical proliferation-resistant reactor designs with passive safety features although government labs research the same areas as industry they also study a myriad of other issues such as nuclear fuels and nuclear fuel cycles advanced reactor designs and nuclear weapon design and maintenance a principal pipeline for trained personnel for us reactor facilities is the navy nuclear power program the job outlook for nuclear engineering from the year 2012 to the year 2022 is predicted to grow 9% due to many elder nuclear engineers retiring safety systems needing to be updated in power plants and the advancements made in nuclear medicine nuclear powerplant b-61 thermonuclear weapon nuclear medicine and medical physics an important field is medical physics and its subfields nuclear medicine radiation therapy health physics and diagnostic imaging from x-ray machines to mri to pet among many others medical physics provides most of modern medicines diagnostic capability along with providing many treatment options x-ray image of a male skull magnetic resonance imaging scan of a head pet taken with an ecat exact hr+ pet scanner nuclear materials nuclear materials research focuses on two main subject areas nuclear fuels and irradiation-induced modification of materials improvement of three nuclear fuels is crucial for obtaining increased efficiency from nuclear reactors irradiation effects studies have many purposes from studying structural changes to reactor components to studying nano-modification of metals using ion-beams or particle accelerators uranium ore the principal raw material of nuclear fuel nuclear fuel pellets a focused ion beam radiation protection and measurement radiation measurement is fundamental to the science and practice of radiation protection sometimes known as radiological protection which is the protection of people and the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation nuclear engineers and radiological scientists are interested in the development of more advanced ionizing radiation measurement and detection systems and using these to improve imaging technologies this includes detector design fabrication and analysis measurements of fundamental atomic and nuclear parameters and radiation imaging systems among other things a modern geiger counter a neutron detector scintillation detector next to uraninite hand-held large area alpha scintillation probe under calibration hand-held integral ion chamber survey meter in use nuclear engineering organizations american nuclear society nuclear institute uk international atomic energy agency
