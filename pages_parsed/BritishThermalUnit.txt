british thermal unit btu redirects here for other uses see btu disambiguation the british thermal unit btu or btu is a traditional unit of work equal to about 1055 joules it is the amount of work needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit physical analogue one four-inch wooden kitchen match consumed completely generates approximately 1 btu in science the joule the si unit of energy has largely replaced the btu the btuh is most often used as a measure of power in the power steam generation heating and air conditioning industries it is still used in some metric english-speaking countries such as canada but notably not the united kingdom in north america the heat value energy content of fuels is expressed in btus the notation kbtu or kbtu is often used for thousand btu in sizing of heating systems and in the energy use index eui expressed as thousand btu annual energy use per square foot of building mbtu represents one million btu although the atypical notation mmbtu or mmbtu is sometimes used to represent one million btusee definitions below definitions a btu is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 avoirdupois pound of liquid water by 1 degree fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one atmosphere as with the calorie several definitions of the btu exist because the temperature response of water to heat energy is non-linear this means that the change in temperature of a water mass caused by adding a certain amount of heat to it will be a function of the waters initial temperature definitions of the btu based on different water temperatures can therefore vary by up to 0.5% the unit mbtu or mbtu was defined as one thousand btu presumably from the roman numeral system where m or m stands for one thousand 1,000 this notation is easily confused with the si mega- m prefix which denotes multiplication by a factor of one million ×106 or with the si milli- m prefix which denotes division by a factor of one thousand ×10−3 to avoid confusion some companies and engineers use the notation mmbtu or mmbtu to represent one million btu although confusingly mm in roman numerals would traditionally represent 2,000 and in many contexts this form of notation is deprecated and discouraged in favour of the more modern si prefixes alternatively the term therm may be used to represent 100,000 or 105 btu and quad for 1015 btu some companies also use btue6 in order to reduce confusion between 103 btu and 106 btu conversions one btu is approximately 1.054 to 1.060 kj kilojoules 0.293071 wh watt hours 252 to 253 cal calories or little calories 0.25 kcal kilocalories large calories or food calories 25,031 to 25,160 ftpdl foot-poundal 778 to 782 ftlbf foot-pounds-force 5.40395 lbfin2ft3 a btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a one-pound weight 778 feet 237 m for natural gas in natural gas by convention 1 mmbtu 1 million btu = 1.054615 gj the energy content high or low heating value of a volume of natural gas varies with the composition of the natural gas which means there is no universal conversion factor for the number of btu to volume 1 standard cubic foot of average natural gas yields ≈ 1030 btu between 1010 btu and 1070 btu depending on quality when burned as a coarse approximation 1000 ft3 of natural gas yields ≈ 1 mmbtu ≈ 1 gj 1 ft3 of natural gas yields ≈ 1000 btu for natural gas price conversion 1000 m3 ≈ 36.906 mmbtu and 1 mmbtu ≈ 27.096 m3 as a unit of power when used as a unit of power for heating and cooling systems btu per hour btuh is the correct unit though this is often abbreviated to just btu 1 watt is approximately 3.41214 btuh 1000 btuh is approximately 293.071 w 1 horsepower is approximately 2544 btuh associated units 1 ton of cooling a common unit in north american refrigeration and air conditioning applications is 12,000 btuh 3.52 kw it is the amount of power needed to freeze 1 short ton 0.893 long tons 0.907 t of water into ice in 24 hours 1 therm is defined in the united states and european union as 100,000 btubut the us uses the btu59 °f while the eu uses the btuit the therm is used to price natural gas 1 quad short for quadrillion btu is 1015 btu which is about one exajoule 7018105500000000000♠1.055×1018 j quads are used in the united states for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies for example the us economy used 99.75 quads in 2005 one quadyear is about 33.43 gigawatts the btu should not be confused with the board of trade unit botu which is a much larger quantity of energy 1 kwh or 3,412 btu the btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in btu required to generate 1 kwh of electrical energy a typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500 btukwh an efficiency of 32-33%
