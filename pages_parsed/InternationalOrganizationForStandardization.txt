isoiec jtc1sc29wg11 a working group wg of experts is set up by the tcsc for the preparation of a working draft when the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified some of the working groups eg mpeg usually make open request for proposalsknown as a call for proposals the first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model vm previously also called a simulation and test model when a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached a working draft wd is produced this is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision when a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed it becomes committee draft cd if it is required it is then sent to the p-members of the tcsc national bodies for ballot the cd becomes final committee draft fcd if the number of positive votes is above the quorum successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content when it is reached the text is finalized for submission as a draft international standard dis the text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months it is approved for submission as a final draft international standard fdis if a two-thirds majority of the p-members of the tcsc are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative iso will then hold a ballot with national bodies where no technical changes are allowed yesno ballot within a period of two months it is approved as an international standard is if a two-thirds majority of the p-members of the tcsc is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative after approval only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text the final text is sent to the iso central secretariat which publishes it as the international standard products named after iso the fact that many of the iso-created standards are ubiquitous has led on occasion to common use of iso to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard some examples of this are many cd images end in the file extension iso to signify that they are using the iso 9660 standard file system as opposed to another file systemhence cd images are commonly referred to as isos virtually all computers with cd-rom drives that can read cds use this standard some dvd-roms also use iso 9660 file systems photographic films sensitivity to light its film speed is described by iso 6 iso 2240 and iso 5800 hence the films speed is often referred to as by its iso number as it was originally defined in iso 518 the flash hot shoe found on cameras is often called the iso shoe criticism with the exception of a small number of isolated standards iso standards are normally not available free of charge but for a purchase fee which has been seen by some as too expensive for small open source projects the isoiec jtc1 fast-track procedures fast-track as used by ooxml and pas as used by opendocument have garnered criticism in relation to the standardization of office open xml isoiec 29500 martin bryan outgoing convenor of isoiec jtc1sc34 wg1 is quoted as saying i would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass wg1s outstanding standards over to oasis where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a pas submission to iso which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within wg1 the disparity of rules for pas fast-track and iso committee generated standards is fast making iso a laughing stock in it circles the days of open standards development are fast disappearing instead we are getting standardization by corporation computer security entrepreneur and ubuntu investor mark shuttleworth commented on the standardization of office open xml process by saying i think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process and shuttleworth alleged that iso did not carry out its responsibility he also noted that microsoft had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in iso and stacked technical committees with microsoft employees solution providers and resellers sympathetic to office open xml when you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused iso should halt the process iso is an engineering old boys club and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results the process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate lobbying and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear
