energy efficiency in transportation this page describes energy efficiency in means of transportation for the environmental impact assessment of a given product or service throughout its lifespan see life cycle assessment the energy efficiency of different types of transportation ranges from some hundred kilojoules kj per kilometre for a bicycle to tens of megajoules mj for a helicopter units of measurement efficiency can be expressed in terms of distance per vehicle per unit fuel volume eg kml or miles per gallon us or imperial distance per vehicle per unit fuel mass eg kmkg volume of fuel or total energy consumed per unit distance per vehicle eg l100 km or mj100 km volume of fuel or total energy consumed per unit distance per passenger eg l100 passengerkm volume of fuel or total energy consumed per unit distance per unit mass of cargo transported eg l100 kgkm or mjtkm electricity used per unit distance eg kwh100 km or miles per gallon equivalent mpg-e transportation types for freight transport rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking and air freight is much less efficient walking a 68 kg 150 lb person walking at 4 kmh 2.5 mph requires approximately 210 kilocalories 880 kj of food energy per hour which is equivalent to 4.55 kmmj 1 us gallon 3.8 l of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units 120 mj of energy so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon 0.65 l100 km velomobile main article velomobile velomobiles seem to have the highest energy efficiency in personal transportation at a speed of 50 kmh 31 mph the waw manufacturer claims they need only 0.5 kwh of food energy per 100 km to transport the passenger which is around 1/5 20% of a normal bicycle and 1/50 2% of an average fossil fuel or electric car this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon 2000 kml or 0.05 l100 km other sources give a figure of 1/3.4 29.5% of the energy efficiency of a normal bicycle bicycling a relatively light and slow vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transport a 64 kg 140 lb cyclist riding at 16 kmh 10 mph requires about half the energy per unit distance of walking 43 kcalmi 27 kcalkm or 3.1 kwh 11 mj per 100 km this converts to about 732 mpg-us 0.321 l100 km 879 mpg-imp this figure depends on the speed and mass of the rider greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance a motorized bicycle such as the velosolex allows human power and the assistance of a 49 cm3 3.0 cu in engine giving a range of 160 to 200 mpg-us 1.5-1.2 l100 km 190-240 mpg-impcitation needed electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0 kwh 3.6 mj per 100 kmcitation needed while maintaining speeds in excess of 30 kmh 19 mphcitation needed these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70% of the work with around 3.6 mj 1.0 kwh per 100 km coming from the motor human power including the human energy dramatically changes the efficiency of cycles quoted above as with walking this would include the increase in food consumption due to caloric efficiency of human muscle and cardiovascular efficiency however only the rise in food consumption above the diet of a non-cyclist should be considered to be thorough a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing transporting and packaging of fuel food or fossil fuel the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment while automobiles for example require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans in addition any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 automobiles main article fuel economy in automobiles see also fuel economy-maximizing behaviors automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres l100 km but in some countries including the usa uk and india it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed kml or miles per us or imperial gallon this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel the oak ridge national laboratory ornl states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit btu per us gallon 32 mjl compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon 36.4 mjl for diesel a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy bio-fuels electricity and hydrogen for instance have significant energy inputs in their production because of this the 50-70% efficiency of hydrogen production has to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger we can compare for instance the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58 finally vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span in other words vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem compare for example walking which requires no special equipment at all and an automobile produced in and shipped from another country and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again and used for a limited number of years it has been researched that driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15% example consumption figures solar cars use no fuel charging the batteries entirely from built-in solar panels and typically use less than 3 kwh per 100 miles 67 kjkm or 1.86 kwh100 km the four passenger gem ner uses 169 whmi 203 mpg-e 10.5 kwh100 km which equates to 2.6 kwh100 km per person when fully occupied albeit at only 24 mph 39 kmh the general motors ev1 was rated in a test with a charging efficiency of 373 wh-acmile or 23 kwh100 km approximately equivalent to 2.6 l100 km 110 mpg-imp 90 mpg-us for petroleum-fuelled vehicles chevrolet volt in full electric mode uses 36 kilowatt-hours per 100 miles 810 kjkm 96 mpg-e meaning it may be more energy-efficient than walking for 4 or more passengers the daihatsu charade 993cc turbo diesel 1987-1993 won the most fuel efficient vehicle award for going round the united kingdom consuming an average of 2.82 l100 km 100 mpg-imp it was surpassed only recently by the vw lupo 3 l which consumes about 2.77 l100 km 102 mpg-imp both cars are rare to find on the popular market the daihatsu had major problems with rust and structural safety which contributes to its rarity and the quite short production run the volkswagen polo 1.4 tdi bluemotion and the seat ibiza 1.4 tdi ecomotion both rated at 3.8 l100 km 74 mpg-imp 62 mpg-us combined were the most fuel efficient cars on sale in the uk as of 22 march 2008dated info honda insight - achieves 48 mpg-us 4.9 l100 km 58 mpg-imp under real-world conditions honda civic hybrid- regularly averages around 45 mpg-us 5.2 l100 km

states car of 2008 in the uk the official fuel consumption figure combined for the prius is 4.3 l100 km 66 mpg-imp 55 mpg-us 2012 cadillac cts-v wagon 6.2 l supercharged 14 mpg-us 17 l100 km 17 mpg-imp 2012 bugatti veyron 10 mpg-us 24 l100 km 12 mpg-imp aircraft main article fuel economy in aircraft main article environmental impact of aviation a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress drag is proportional to the lift required for flight which is equal to the weight of the aircraft as induced drag increases with weight mass reduction with improvements in engine efficiency and reductions in aerodynamic drag has been a principal source of efficiency gains in aircraft with a rule-of-thumb being that a 1% weight reduction corresponds to around a 0.75% reduction in fuel consumption flight altitude affects engine efficiency jet-engine efficiency increases at altitude up to the tropopause the temperature minimum of the atmosphere at lower temperatures the carnot efficiency is higher jet engine efficiency is also increased at high speeds but above about mach 0.85 the airframe aerodynamic losses increase faster compressibility effects beginning at transonic speeds of around mach 0.85 shockwaves form increasing drag for supersonic flight it is difficult to achieve a lift to drag ratio greater than 5 and fuel consumption is increased in proportion passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l100 km per passenger 1.4 mjpassenger-km 49 passenger-miles per gallon in 1998citation needed note that on average 20% of seats are left unoccupied jet aircraft efficiencies are improving between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55% overall fuel efficiency gain if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4% concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon similar to a business jet but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft airbus states a fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l100 km per passenger 78 passenger-miles per us gallon as over 80% of the fully laden take-off weight of a modern aircraft such as the airbus a380 is craft and fuel there remains considerable room for future improvements in fuel efficiencycitation needed the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium carbon fiber and other composite plastics expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency for example the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials airbus has showcased wingtip devices sharklets or winglets that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380 further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing can be retrofitted to any airplane and smooths out the wing-tip vortex reducing the aircrafts wing drag nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500 lb 230 kg blended wing aircraft this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift not just the wings the blended wing body bwb concept offers advantages in structural aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over todays more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs these features translate into greater range fuel economy reliability and life cycle savings as well as lower manufacturing costs nasa has created a cruise efficient stol cestol concept fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research ifam have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450 mph 700 kmh this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today however the decrease in speed reduces drag with the current dated info high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engineairframe efficiency to reduce emissions there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb for instance airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project atp where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate small aircraft motor-gliders made of composite materials can reach an extremely low fuel consumption for cross-country flights using thermal air currents and winds at 160 kmh a diesel powered two-seater dieselis burns 6 liters of fuel per hour 1.9 liters per 100 passenger km at 220 kmh a four-seater 100 hp mcr-4s burns 20 liters of gas per hour 2.2 liters per 100 passenger km under continuous motorised flight at 225 kmh a pipistrel sinus burns 11 liters of fuel per flight hour carrying 2 people aboard it operates at 2.4 liters per 100 passenger km ultralight aircraft tecnam p92 echo classic at cruise speed of 185 kmh burns 17 liters of fuel per flight hour 4.6 liters per 100 passenger km 2 people other modern ultralight aircraft have increased efficiency tecnam p2002 sierra rg at cruise speed of 237 kmh burns 17 liters of fuel per flight hour 3.6 liters per 100 passenger km 2 people two-seater and four-seater flying at 250 kmh with old generation engines can burn 25 to 40 liters per flight hour 3 to 5 liters per 100 passenger km the sikorsky s-76c++ twin turbine helicopter gets about 1.65 mpg-us 143 l100 km 1.98 mpg-imp at 140 knots 260 kmh 160 mph and carries 12 for about 19.8 passenger-miles per gallon 11.9 l per 100 passenger kmcitation needed ships queen elizabeth cunard states that the rms queen elizabeth 2 travels 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil 3.32 ml or 41.2 ftus gal and that it has a passenger capacity of 1777 thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon 16.9 l100 pkm or 13.9 pmpg-us emma maersk emma maersk uses a wärtsilä-sulzer rta96-c which consumes 163 gkwh and 13,000 kgh if it carries 13,000 containers then 1 kg fuel transports one container for one hour over a distance of 45 km the ship takes 18 days from tanjung singapore to rotterdam netherlands 11 from tanjung to suez and 7 from suez to rotterdam which is roughly 430 hours and has 80 mw +30 mw 18 days at a mean speed of 25 knots 46 kmh gives a total distance of 10,800 nautical miles 20,000 km sailboats a sailboat much like a solar car can locomote without consuming any fuel a sail boat such as a dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion such as cooking heating or lighting the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine the speed at which it travels and its displacement due to the high viscosity of water with a single passenger the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car train or plane trains trains can be an efficient means of transport for freight and passengers efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply for electrified systems and importantly end-to-end delivery where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey actual consumption depends on gradients maximum speeds loading and stopping patterns data produced for the european meet project methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections the results show the consumption for a german ice high-speed train varied from around 19 to 33 kwhkm 68-119 mjkm 31-53 kwhmi the data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger for example tgv double-deck duplex trains use lightweight materials which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy freight energy consumption estimates for rail freight vary widely and many are provided by interested parties some are tabulated below passenger considering only the energy spent to move the train and taking as example the urban area of lisbon train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers if we consider energy spent per passenger-km considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6 l100 km 47 mpg-imp 39 mpg-us of gasoline the fact the on average cars in europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline amounts for about 8826 wh one gets on average 441 wh 1,590 kj per passenger-km on the other hand a modern urban train with an average occupation of 20% of total capacity which has a consumption of about 8.5 kwhkm 31 mjkm 13.7 kwhmi one gets 21.5 wh per passenger-km 20 times less than the automobile braking losses stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency modern electric trains like the shinkansen the bullet train use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6% of the total energy consumed the passenger rail urban and intercity and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements - final report states that commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops and that we estimate head-end power to be 35 percent but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent of total energy consumed by commuter railways having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20% of the energy wasted in braking weight is a determinant of braking losses other references aea study of road and rail for the united kingdom department for transport final report buses in july 2005 the average occupancy for buses in the uk was stated to be 9 the fleet of 244 40-foot 12 m 1982 new flyer trolley buses in local service with bc transit in vancouver canada in 1994/95 used 35,454,170 kwh for 12,966,285 vehicle km or 9.84 mjvehicle km exact ridership on trolleybuses is not known but with all 34 seats filled this equates to 0.32 mjpassenger km it is quite common to see people standing on vancouver trolleybuses this is a service with many stops per kilometre part of the reason for the efficiency is the use of regenerative braking a commuter service in santa barbara california usa found average diesel bus efficiency of 6.0 mpg-us 39 l100 km 7.2 mpg-imp using mci 102dl3 buses with all 55 seats filled this equates to 330 passenger mpg with 70% filled 231 passenger mpg in 2011 the fleet of 752 buses in the city of lisbon had an average speed of 14.4 kmh and an average occupancy of 20.1 passengers per vehicle other nasas crawler-transporter is used to move the shuttle from storage to the launch pad it uses diesel and has one of the highest fuel consumption rates on record 150 us gallons per mile 350 lkm 120 imp galmi international transport comparisons uk public transport rail and bus are generally required to serve off peak and rural services which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines moreover due to their walk on ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers as a consequence the overall load factor on uk railways is 35% or 90 people per train conversely air services work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are pre-book in nature using yield management overall loads can be raised to around 70-90% however recently intercity train operators have been using similar techniques with loads reaching typically 71% overall for tgv services in france and a similar figure for the uks virgin trains services for emissions the electricity generating source needs to be taken into account us passenger transportation the us transportation energy data book states the following figures for passenger transportation in 2009 us freight transportation the us transportation energy book states the following figures for freight transportation in 2010 from 1960 to 2010 the efficiency of air freight has increased 75% mostly due to more efficient jet engines 1 us gal 3.785 l 0.833 imp gal of fuel can move a ton of cargo 857 km

lifting 10 mj per tonne kilometre canadian transportation natural resources canadas office of energy efficiency publishes annual statistics regarding the efficiency of the entire canadian fleet for researchers these fuel consumption estimates are more realistic than the fuel consumption ratings of new vehicles as they represent the real world driving conditions including extreme weather and traffic the annual report is called energy efficiency trends analysis there are dozens of tables illustrating trends in energy consumption expressed in energy per passenger km passengers or energy per tonne km freight caveats comparing fuel efficiency in transportation has several challenges all transportation methods require a different infrastructure the building repairing and renovation of this must also be considered and heavy usage of infrastructure will require earlier maintenance which will also be energy consuming road transport requires an extensive network of well-maintained paved roads and trains require railroads and stations along the whole length of the track meanwhile ships and aircraft only require a more limited amount of harbours or airports without any en route infrastructure except for the occasional navigation beacon all transportation also requires storage inspection preparation and boarding areas the size of the vehicle and supporting items including security parking areas especially when required due to distance from densely populated areas baggage removal and boarding aids such as ramps gangplanks or jet bridges should be taken into account for total area used by each for of transportation some types of transportation can take shorter routes thereby partly offsetting an increase in energy consumption per unit of distance traveled for example a trip from the uk to italy would take a boat an enormous detour via the strait of gibraltar while cars need to travel much less distance a train can cross through the channel tunnel and aircraft can theoretically in reality its going from good to better take by the shortest route or in case of favorable winds a more efficient route while aircraft ideally can travel the shortest distance they do require takeoff and landing with specific directions related to wind conditions and airport runway locations these require course corrections during takeoff and landing additionally there are cases where aircraft require circling due to congestion at airports where other forms of transportation can stop and idle when there is congestion airplanes cannot do this and can occasionally travel a farther distance than strictly necessary there is a distinction between vehicle mpge and passenger mpge most of these entries cite passenger mpge even if not explicitly stated it is important not to compare energy figures that relate to dissimilar journeys an airline jet cannot be used for an urban commute so when comparing aircraft with cars the car figures must take this into account there is currently no agreed method of comparing electric vehicle efficiency to heat engine fossil fuel vehicle efficiency but typical emissions and thermal energy consumption can be compared vehicle speed is also an important parameter and a peer-reviewed evaluation which convolves these criteria may be found at httpbenthamopencomcontentspdftoefjtoefj-1-11pdf if the issue is rapid investment in new electric mass transit it is important to use emissions associated with the most polluting fuel because increased demand for electricity increases the use of polluting fuel used in generation for the immediate future as well as low emissions fuels in the case of some countries systems that re-use vehicles like trains and buses cant be directly compared to vehicles that get parked at their destination they use energy to return less full for more passengers and must sometimes run on schedules and routes with little patronage these factors greatly affect overall system efficiencies the energy costs of accumulating load need to be included in the case of most mass transit distributing and accumulating load over many stops means that passenger kilometres are inherently a small proportion of vehicle kilometres see transport energy metrics lessons from the west coast main line modernisation and figures for london underground in transport statistics for great britain 2003 lessons from the west coast mainline modernisation suggest that long passenger rail should operate at less than 40% capacity utilisation and for london underground the figure is probably less than 15% most cars run at less than full capacity with the usual average load being between 1 and 2 cars are also subject to inefficiencies because of congestion and the need to negotiate road junctions the impact of transport road building to reduce congestion should always be considered as should the improving efficiency of cars see httpwebarchivenationalarchivesgovuk20071204132715httpwwwhm-treasurygovukmedia9/5pbrcsr07king840pdf vehicles are not isolated systems they usually form a part of larger systems whose design inherently determines energy consumption judging the value of transport systems by comparing the performance of their vehicles alone can be misleading for instance metro systems may have a poor energy efficiency per passenger kilometre but their high throughput and low physical footprint makes the existence of high urban population densities viable total energy consumption per capita declines sharply as population density increases since journeys become shorter see also logistics and transport focus the journal of the charter institute of transport vol 9 number 10 through volume 10 number 6 for a
