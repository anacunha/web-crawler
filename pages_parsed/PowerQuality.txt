power quality power quality determines the fitness of electric power to consumer devices synchronization of the voltage frequency and phase allows electrical systems to function in their intended manner without significant loss of performance or life the term is used to describe electric power that drives an electrical load and the loads ability to function properly without the proper power an electrical device or load may malfunction fail prematurely or not operate at all there are many ways in which electric power can be of poor quality and many more causes of such poor quality power the electric power industry comprises electricity generation ac power electric power transmission and ultimately electric power distribution to an electricity meter located at the premises of the end user of the electric power the electricity then moves through the wiring system of the end user until it reaches the load the complexity of the system to move electric energy from the point of production to the point of consumption combined with variations in weather generation demand and other factors provide many opportunities for the quality of supply to be compromised while power quality is a convenient term for many it is the quality of the voltagerather than power or electric currentthat is actually described by the term power is simply the flow of energy and the current demanded by a load is largely uncontrollable introduction the quality of electrical power may be described as a set of values of parameters such as continuity of service variation in voltage magnitude see below transient voltages and currents harmonic content in the waveforms for ac power it is often useful to think of power quality as a compatibility problem is the equipment connected to the grid compatible with the events on the grid and is the power delivered by the grid including the events compatible with the equipment that is connected compatibility problems always have at least two solutions in this case either clean up the power or make the equipment tougher the tolerance of data-processing equipment to voltage variations is often characterized by the cbema curve which give the duration and magnitude of voltage variations that can be tolerated ideally ac voltage is supplied by a utility as sinusoidal having an amplitude and frequency given by national standards in the case of mains or system specifications in the case of a power feed not directly attached to the mains with an impedance of zero ohms at all frequencies no real-life power source is ideal and generally can deviate in at least the following ways variations in the peak or rms voltage are both important to different types of equipment when the rms voltage exceeds the nominal voltage by 10 to 80% for 0.5 cycle to 1 minute the event is called a swell a dip in british english or a sag in american english the two terms are equivalent is the opposite situation the rms voltage is below the nominal voltage by 10 to 90% for 0.5 cycle to 1 minute random or repetitive variations in the rms voltage between 90 and 110% of nominal can produce a phenomenon known as flicker in lighting equipment flicker is rapid visible changes of light level definition of the characteristics of voltage fluctuations that produce objectionable light flicker has been the subject of ongoing research abrupt very brief increases in voltage called spikes impulses or surges generally caused by large inductive loads being turned off or more severely by lightning undervoltage occurs when the nominal voltage drops below 90% for more than 1 minute the term brownout is an apt description for voltage drops somewhere between full power bright lights and a blackout no power - no light it comes from the noticeable to significant dimming of regular incandescent lights during system faults or overloading etc when insufficient power is available to achieve full brightness in usually domestic lighting this term is in common usage has no formal definition but is commonly used to describe a reduction in system voltage by the utility or system operator to decrease demand or to increase system operating margins overvoltage occurs when the nominal voltage rises above 110% for more than 1 minute variations in the frequency variations in the wave shape - usually described as harmonics at lower frequencies usually less than 3khz and described as common mode distortion or interharmonics at higher frequencies nonzero low-frequency impedance when a load draws more power the voltage drops nonzero high-frequency impedance when a load demands a large amount of current then stops demanding it suddenly there will be a dip or spike in the voltage due to the inductances in the power supply line each of these power quality problems has a different cause some problems are a result of the shared infrastructure for example a fault on the network may cause a dip that will affect some customers the higher the level of the fault the greater the number affected a problem on one customers site may cause a transient that affects all other customers on the same subsystem problems such as harmonics arise within the customers own installation and may propagate onto the network and affect other customers harmonic problems can be dealt with by a combination of good design practice and well proven reduction equipment power conditioning power conditioning is modifying the power to improve its quality an uninterruptible power supply can be used to switch off of mains power if there is a transient temporary condition on the line however cheaper ups units create poor-quality power themselves akin to imposing a higher-frequency and lower-amplitude square wave atop the sine wave high-quality ups units utilize a double conversion topology which breaks down incoming ac power into dc charges the batteries then remanufactures an ac sine wave this remanufactured sine wave is of higher quality than the original ac power feed a surge protector or simple capacitor or varistor can protect against most overvoltage conditions while a lightning arrester protects against severe spikes electronic filters can remove harmonics smart grids and power quality modern systems use sensors called phasor measurement units pmu distributed throughout their network to monitor power quality and in some cases respond automatically to them using such smart grids features of rapid sensing and automated self healing of anomalies in the network promises to bring higher quality power and less downtime while simultaneously supporting power from intermittent power sources and distributed generation which would if unchecked degrade power quality notes ^ pgecom -
