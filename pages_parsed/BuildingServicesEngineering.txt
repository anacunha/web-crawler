building services engineering building services engineering technical building services architectural engineering building engineering or facilities and services planning engineering refers to the implementation of the engineering for the internal environment and environmental impact of a building building services engineers are responsible for the design installation operation and monitoring of the mechanical electrical and public health systems required for the safe comfortable and environmentally friendly operation of modern buildings the term building services engineering is widely used in the united kingdom ireland canada and australia but in the united states of america the field is also known as architectural engineering or building engineering though these terms can also have other meanings even in the united states in india the engineers are known as facilities planners a building services architect is an engineer with experience in the integration of building services field building services engineering comprises mechanical engineering electrical engineering and plumbing or public health mep engineering all of which are further sub-divided into the following communication lines telephones and it networks ict energy supply - gas electricity and renewable sources escalators and lifts fire detection and protection heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac lightning protection low voltage lv systems distribution boards and switchgear natural lighting and artificial lighting and building facades security and alarm systems ventilation and refrigeration water drainage and plumbing building services engineers work closely with other construction professionals such as architects structural engineers and quantity surveyors they influence the architecture of a building and play a significant role on the sustainability and energy demand of a building within building services engineering new roles are emerging for example in the areas of renewable energy sustainability low carbon technologies and energy management with buildings accounting for around 50% of all carbon emissions building services engineers play a significant role in combating climate change as such a typical building services engineer has a wide-ranging career path design designing layouts and requirements for building services for residential or commercial developments design management -design management is the business side of design which aims to create the right environment to control and support a culture of creativity and innovation and to embrace the iterative nature of design involving the many disciplines that collectively will deliver design solutions - and all at the same time as ensuring that an organisations commercial goals and objectives are achieved and that all is done in an ethically sound way typically the building services engineering installation is worth 30-60% of the total value of a contract design management is not the same as project management project management focuses on a wider range of administrative skills but is not normally sympathetic to the peculiarities of delivering a fully coordinated functioning design taking into account its unique nature and dealing with the changing requirements of clients and the external factors over which there is little control construction supervising the construction of the building services commissioning systems and ongoing maintenance and operation of services environmental developing new energy saving methods for construction designing new and improved energy conservation systems for buildings heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac specialising in the design development construction and operation of hvac systems electrical technology specialising in the design and development of electrical systems required for safe and energy sustaining operation of buildings in 1976 chartered institution of building services engineers cibse was founded and received a royal charter in the united kingdom and formally recognising building services engineering as a profession its objectives of the institution are to support the science art and practice of building services engineering by providing our members and the public with first class information and education services and promoting the spirit of fellowship which guides our work in recent years there has been increasing emphasis on sustainable and green design by the uk government including in engineered building systems building services engineers increasingly seek breeam bre environmental assessment method cibse low carbon consultants lcc and energy assessors lcea status in addition to their professional engineering registration building services engineering software many building services firms use computer-aided engineering and computer-aided design cadsoftware programs created either in-house or by external parties to assist in their system design and analysis this method has many benefits including easier and more exhaustive visualization of proposed solutions the ability to create virtual models for analysis and calculations and the ease of use in spatial planning the latest trend in mep or building services engineering is the utilization of building information modeling or bim which may include 3d and 4d modeling 3d bim services enable building visualization preview or prototype of architectural structures before actual construction lately major companies are also using bim for 4d visualization bim 4d allows for more informed decision making and better coordination between designers and builders considering time also as an important factor education building services engineers typically possess an academic degree in building services engineering mechanical engineering or electrical engineering the length of study for such a degree is usually 4 years for a bachelor of engineering beng or bachelor of science bsc and six years for a master of engineering meng some of the degrees accredited by the chartered institution of building services engineers include bachelors benghons meng
