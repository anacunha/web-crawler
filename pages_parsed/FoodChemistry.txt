food chemistry food chemistry redirects here for the journal see food chemistry journal food chemistry is the study of chemical processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods the biological substances include such items as meat poultry lettuce beer and milk as examples it is similar to biochemistry in its main components such as carbohydrates lipids and protein but it also includes areas such as water vitamins minerals enzymes food additives flavors and colors this discipline also encompasses how products change under certain food processing techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening an example of enhancing a process would be to encourage fermentation of dairy products with microorganisms that convert lactose to lactic acid an example of preventing a process would be stopping the browning on the surface of freshly cut red delicious apples using lemon juice or other acidulated water history of food chemistry the scientific approach to food and nutrition arose with attention to agricultural chemistry in the works of j g wallerius humphry davy and others for example davy published elements of agricultural chemistry in a course of lectures for the board of agriculture 1813 in the united kingdom which would serve as a foundation for the profession worldwide going into a fifth edition earlier work included that by carl wilhelm scheele who isolated malic acid from apples in 1785 in 1874 the society of public analysts was formed with the aim of applying analytical methods to the benefit of the public its early experiments were based on bread milk and wine it was also out of concern for the quality of the food supply mainly food adulteration and contamination issues that would first stem from intentional contamination to later with chemical food additives by the 1950s the development of colleges and universities worldwide most notably in the united states would expand food chemistry as well with research of the dietary substances most notably the single-grain experiment during 1907-11 additional research by harvey w wiley at the united states department of agriculture during the late 19th century would play a key factor in the creation of the united states food and drug administration in 1906 the american chemical society would establish their agricultural and food chemistry division in 1908 while the institute of food technologists would establish their food chemistry division in 1995 food chemistry concepts are often drawn from rheology theories of transport phenomena physical and chemical thermodynamics chemical bonds and interaction forces quantum mechanics and reaction kinetics biopolymer science colloidal interactions nucleation glass transitions and freezingdisordered or noncrystalline solids and thus has food physical chemistry as a foundation area water in food systems main article water a major component of food is water which can encompass anywhere from 50% in meat products to 95% in lettuce cabbage and tomato products it is also an excellent place for bacterial growth and food spoilage if it is not properly processed one way this is measured in food is by water activity which is very important in the shelf life of many foods during processing one of the keys to food preservation in most instances is reduce the amount of water or alter the waters characteristics to enhance shelf-life such methods include dehydration freezing and refrigeration this field encompasses the physiochemical principles of the reactions and conversions that occur during the manufacture handling and storage of foods carbohydrates main article carbohydrate comprising 75% of the biological world and 80% of all food intake for human consumption the most common known human carbohydrate is sucrosecitation needed the simplest version of a carbohydrate is a monosaccharide which possesses the properties of carbon hydrogen and oxygen in a 1:2:1 ratio under a general formula of cnh2non where n is a minimum of 3 glucose is an example of a monosaccharide as is fructose combine them in the picture shown to the right and you have sucrose one of the more common sugar products around a chain of monosaccharides form to make a polysaccharide such polysaccharides include pectin dextran agar and xanthan sugar content is commonly measured in degrees brix lipids main article lipid the term lipid comprises a diverse range of molecules and to some extent is a catchall for relatively water-insoluble or nonpolar compounds of biological origin including waxes fatty acids including essential fatty acids fatty-acid derived phospholipids sphingolipids glycolipids and terpenoids such as retinoids and steroids some lipids are linear aliphatic molecules while others have ring structures some are aromatic while others are not some are flexible while others are rigid most lipids have some polar character in addition to being largely nonpolar generally the bulk of their structure is nonpolar or hydrophobic water-fearing meaning that it does not interact well with polar solvents like water another part of their structure is polar or hydrophilic water-loving and will tend to associate with polar solvents like water this makes them amphiphilic molecules having both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions in the case of cholesterol the polar group is a mere -oh hydroxyl or alcohol lipids in food include the oils of such grains as corn soybean from animal fats and are parts of many foods such as milk cheese and meat they also act as vitamin carriers as well food proteins main article protein nutrient proteins compose over 50% of the dry weight of an average living cellcitation neededclarification needed and are very complex macromolecules they also play a fundamental role in the structure and function of cells consisting mainly of carbon nitrogen hydrogen oxygen and some sulfur they also may contain iron copper phosphorus or zinc in food proteins are essential for growth and survival and vary depending upon a persons age and physiology eg pregnancy protein is commonly obtained from animal sources eggs milk and meat nuts grains and legumes provide vegetable sources of protein and protein combining of vegetable sources is used to achieve complete protein nutritional quotas from vegetables protein sensitivity as food allergy is detected with the elisa test enzymes main article enzyme enzymes are biochemical catalysts used in converting processes from one substance to another they are also involved in reducing the amount of time and energy required to complete a chemical process many aspects of the food industry use catalysts including baking brewing dairy and fruit juices to make cheese beer and bread vitamins main article vitamin vitamins are nutrients required in small amounts for essential metabolic reactions in the body these are broken down in nutrition as either water-soluble vitamin c or fat-soluble vitamin e an adequate supply of vitamins can prevent diseases such as beriberi anemia and scurvy while an overdose of vitamins can produce nausea and vomiting or even death minerals main article dietary mineral dietary minerals in foods are large and diverse with many required to function while other trace elements can be hazardous if consumed in excessive amounts bulk minerals with a reference daily intake rdi formerly recommended daily allowance rda of more than 200 mgday are calcium magnesium and potassium while important trace minerals rdi less than 200 mgday are copper iron and zinc these are found in many foods but can also be taken in dietary supplements color main article food coloring food coloring is added to change the color of any food substance it is mainly for sensory analysis purposes it can be used to simulate the natural color of a product as perceived by the customer such as red dye like fdc red no40 allura red ac to ketchup or to add unnatural colors to a product like kelloggs froot loops caramel is a natural food dye the industrial form caramel coloring is the most widely used food coloring and is found in foods from soft drinks to soy sauce bread and pickles flavors main article flavor flavor in food is important in how food smells and tastes to the consumer especially in sensory analysis some of these products occur naturally like salt and sugar but flavor chemists called a flavorist develop many of these flavors for food products such artificial flavors include methyl salicylate which creates the wintergreen odor and lactic acid which gives milk a tart taste food additives main article food additive food additives are substances added to food for preserving flavors or improving taste or appearance the processes are as old as adding vinegar for pickling or as an emulsifier for emulsion mixtures like mayonnaise these are generally listed by e number in the european union or gras generally recognized as safe by the united states food and drug administration
