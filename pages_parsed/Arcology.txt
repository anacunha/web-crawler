arcology this article is about self-contained habitations for the study of human activity in the past see archaeology arcology a portmanteau of architecture and ecology is a vision of architectural design principles for very densely populated habitats the concept has been primarily popularized and the term itself coined by architect paolo soleri it also appears in science fiction these structures have been largely hypothetical insofar as no arcology envisioned by soleri himself has yet been completed but he posited that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential commercial and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact arcologies are often portrayed in sci-fi as self-contained or economically self-sufficient development an arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem it could be self-sustainable employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life power climate control food production air and water conservation and purification sewage treatment etc an arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population an arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own arcology was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven post-automobile to be difficult to achieve in other ways frank lloyd wright proposed an early version called broadacre city although in contrast to an arcology wrights idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network wrights plan described transportation agriculture and commerce systems that would support an economy critics said that wrights solution failed to account for population growth and assumed a more rigid democracy than the usa actually has buckminster fuller proposed the old man rivers city project a domed city with a capacity of 125,000 as a solution to the housing problems in east st louis illinois paolo soleri proposed later solutions and coined the term arcology soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl to economize on transportation and other energy uses like wright soleri proposed changes in transportation agriculture and commerce soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication land reclamation he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation he advocated for greater frugality and favored greater use of shared social resources including public transit and public libraries similar real-world projects arcosanti is an experimental arcology prototype - a demonstration project under construction in central arizona designed by paolo soleri its primary purpose is to demonstrate soleris personal designs his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept like tokyo and dongtan near shanghai the dongtan project may have collapsed and it failed to open for the shanghai world expo in 2010 certain urban projects reflect arcology principles pedestrian connection systems often provide a wide range of goods and services in a single structure some examples include the +15 system in downtown calgary montréals réso or the minneapolis skyway system and the windscreen in fermont quebec they include supermarkets malls and entertainment complexes the +15 is the worlds most extensive skywalk at 16 km 9.9 mi in total length minneapolis has the longest single path at 13 km 8 mi sewards success alaska was never built but would have been a small city just outside anchorage chicago has a sizeable tunnel system known as the chicago pedway connecting a portion of the buildings in the chicago loop the las vegas strip has many arcology features to protect people from the 45 °c 113 °f heat many major casinos are connected by tunnels footbridges and monorails it is possible to travel from mandalay bay at the south end of the strip to the las vegas convention center three miles 5 km to the north without using streets in many cases it is possible to travel between several different casinos without ever going outdoors it is possible to live in this complex without need to venture outside except the strip has not generally been considered self-sustainable soleri did not advocate for enclosed cities although he did sketch a design and build a model of an arcology for outer space the toronto downtown area features an underground pedestrian network path multiple high-rises are connected by a series of underground tunnels it is possible to live in this complex without needing to venture outside but the path network is not self-sustaining nor is it presently self-sustainable the total network spans 28-kilometres 17 mi mcmurdo station of the united states antarctic program and other scientific research stations on the continent of antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced relatively self-sufficient human community the antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character the station is not self-sufficient the us military delivers 30,000 cubic metres 800,000 us gal of fuel and 5 kilotonnes 11 million pounds of supplies and equipment yearly through its operation deep freeze resupply effort but it is isolated from conventional support networks the base generates electricity with its own power plant and grows fruits and vegetables in a hydroponic green house when resupply is non-existent under international treaty it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem crystal island is a proposed arcology in moscow russia in 2009 construction was postponed indefinitely due to the global economic crisis the begich towers operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of whittier alaska the pair of buildings contains residential housing as well as a school grocery and municipal offices whittier once boasted a second structure known as the buckner building the buckner building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake in popular culture most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial structural or conceptual shortcomings arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works one significant example is the novel oath of fealty by larry niven and jerry pournelle in the novel a segment of the los angeles population has moved into an arcology the plot examines the social changes that result both inside and outside the arcology thus the arcology is presented not just as a plot device but as a subject of critique novels and comics 1899 -
