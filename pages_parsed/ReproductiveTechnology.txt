reproductive technology reproductive technology rt encompasses all current and anticipated uses of technology in human and animal reproduction including assisted reproductive technology contraception and others techniques assisted reproductive technology main article assisted reproductive technology assisted reproductive technology art is the use of reproductive technology to treat infertility this is today the only application of reproductive technology to increase reproduction that is used routinely examples include in vitro fertilization and its possible expansions artificial insemination artificial reproduction cloning see human cloning for the special case of human beings cytoplasmic transfer cryopreservation of sperm oocytes embryos embryo transfer fertility medication hormone treatment in vitro fertilization intracytoplasmic sperm injection in vitro generated gametes preimplantation genetic diagnosis prognostics reproductive technology also includes methods to give an individual prognosis about future chances of pregnancy facilitating an informed choice of family planning in women such methods include mapping of a womans ovarian reserve follicular dynamics and associated biomarkers in males it includes semen analysis contraception contraception is a form of reproductive technology that enables people to control their fertility others the following techniques in contrast to art are not yet routinely used in fact most of them are even at the developmental stage artificial wombs germinal choice technology in vitro parthenogenesis reprogenetics same-sex procreation same-sex procreation where two females could have a daughter with equal genetic contributions from both or where two males could have a son or daughter with equal genetic contributions from both has become a possibility through the creation of either female sperm or male eggs from the cells of adult women and men with female sperm and male eggs lesbian and gay couples wishing to become parents would not have to rely on a third party donor of sperm or egg the first significant development occurred in 1991 in a patent application filed by upenn scientists to fix male sperm by extracting some sperm correcting a genetic defect in vitro and injecting the sperm back into the males testicles while the vast majority of the patent application dealt with male sperm one line suggested that the procedure would work with xx cells ie cells from an adult woman to make female sperm in the two decades that followed the idea of female sperm became more of a reality in 1997 scientists partially confirmed such techniques by creating chicken female sperm in a similar manner they did so by injecting blood stem cells from an adult female chicken into a male chickens testicles some years later other japanese scientists created female offspring by combining the eggs of two adult mice in 2008 research was done specifically for methods on creating human female sperm using artificial or natural y chromosomes and testicular transplantation a uk-based group predicted they would be able to create human female sperm within five years ethics many issues of reproductive technology have given rise to bioethical issues since technology often alters the assumptions that lie behind existing systems of sexual and reproductive morality also ethical issues of human enhancement arise when reproductive technology has evolved to be a potential technology for not only reproductively inhibited people but even for otherwise reproductively healthy people see individual subarticles for details in fiction films and other fiction depicting contemporary emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s decade although the techniques have been available for decades yet the amount of people that can relate to it further information assisted reproductive technology fictional representation science fiction has tackled the themes of creating life through other than the conventional methods since mary shelleys frankenstein in the 20th century aldous huxleys brave new world 1932 was the first major fictional work to anticipate the possible social consequences of reproductive technology its largely negative view was reversed when the author revisited the same themes in his utopian final novel island 1962 further information reproduction and pregnancy in science fiction
