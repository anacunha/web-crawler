biomedical engineering biomedical engineering bme is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes eg diagnostic or therapeutic this field seeks to close the gap between engineering and medicine combining the design and problem solving skills of engineering with medical and biological sciences to advance health care treatment including diagnosis monitoring and therapy biomedical engineering has only recently emerged as its own study compared to many other engineering fields such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an interdisciplinary specialization among already-established fields to being considered a field in itself much of the work in biomedical engineering consists of research and development spanning a broad array of subfields see below prominent biomedical engineering applications include the development of biocompatible prostheses various diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants common imaging equipment such as mris and eegs regenerative tissue growth pharmaceutical drugs and therapeutic biologicals history biomedical engineering has existed for centuries perhaps even thousands of years in 2000 german archaeologists uncovered a 3,000-year-old mummy from thebes with a wooden prosthetic tied to its foot to serve as a big toe researchers said the wear on the bottom surface suggests that it could be the oldest known limb prosthesis 1816 modesty prevented french physician ren√© laennec from placing his ear next to a young womans bare chest so he rolled up a newspaper and listened through it triggering the idea for his invention that led to todays ubiquitous stethoscope the roots of biomedical engineering reach back to early developments in electrophysiology which originated about 200 years ago 1848 an early landmark occurred in electrophysiology hermann von helmholtz is credited with applying engineering principles to a problem in physiology and identifying the resistance of muscle and nervous tissues to direct current 1895 wilhelm roentgen accidentally discovered that a cathode-ray tube could make a sheet of paper coated with barium platinocyanide glow even when the tube and the paper were in separate rooms roentgen decided the tube must be emitting some kind of penetrating rays which he called x rays this set off a flurry of research into the tissue-penetrating and tissue-destroying properties of x-rays a line of research that ultimately produced the modern array of medical imaging technologies and virtually eliminated the need for exploratory surgery origin biomedical engineering originated during world war iiinconsistent biologists were needed to do work involving advances on radar technology which led them to the electronic developments in medicine due to these developments the next generation of biologists could not benefit from this technology as they couldnt understand it a bridge was needed to fill the gap between technical knowledge and biology doctors and biologists who were interested in engineering and electrical engineers interested in biology became the first bioengineers those primarily concerned with medicine became the first biomedical engineers the unique mix of engineering medicine and science in biomedical engineering emerged alongside biophysics and medical physics early this century major milestones biomedical engineering achievements range from early devices such as crutches platform shoes and wooden teeth to more modern equipment including pacemakers heart-lung machine dialysis machines diagnostic equipment imaging technologies of every kind and artificial organs medical implants and advanced prosthetics 1895 conrad roentgen germany discovered the x-ray using gas discharged tubes 1896 henry becquerel france discovered x-rays were emitted from uranium ore 1901 roentgen received the nobel prize for discovery of x-rays 1903 william

health as per the statistics of the national academy of engineering about 32000 biomedical engineers are currently working in various areas of health care technology bioinformatics main article bioinformatics bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data as an interdisciplinary field of science bioinformatics combines computer science statistics mathematics and engineering to analyze and interpret biological data bioinformatics is both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology as well as a reference to specific analysis pipelines that are repeatedly used particularly in the field of genomics common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides snps often such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease unique adaptations desirable properties esp in agricultural species or differences between populations in a less formal way bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences biomechanics main article biomechanics see biomechanics biomaterial main article biomaterial a biomaterial is any matter surface or construct that interacts with living systems as a science biomaterials is about fifty years old the study of biomaterials is called biomaterials science or biomaterials engineering it has experienced steady and strong growth over its history with many companies investing large amounts of money into the development of new products biomaterials science encompasses elements of medicine biology chemistry tissue engineering and materials science biomedical optics main article biomedical optics tissue engineering main article tissue engineering tissue engineering like genetic engineering see below is a major segment of biotechnology - which overlaps significantly with bme one of the goals of tissue engineering is to create artificial organs via biological material for patients that need organ transplants biomedical engineers are currently researching methods of creating such organs researchers have grown solid jawbones and tracheas from human stem cells towards this end several artificial urinary bladders have been grown in laboratories and transplanted successfully into human patients bioartificial organs which use both synthetic and biological component are also a focus area in research such as with hepatic assist devices that use liver cells within an artificial bioreactor construct genetic engineering main article genetic engineering genetic engineering recombinant dna technology genetic modificationmanipulation gm and gene splicing are terms that apply to the direct manipulation of an organisms genes unlike traditional breeding an indirect method of genetic manipulation genetic engineering utilizes modern tools such as molecular cloning and transformation to directly alter the structure and characteristics of target genes genetic engineering techniques have found success in numerous applications some examples include the improvement of crop technology not a medical application but see biological systems engineering the manufacture of synthetic human insulin through the use of modified bacteria the manufacture of erythropoietin in hamster ovary cells and the production of new types of experimental mice such as the oncomouse cancer mouse for research neural engineering neural engineering also known as neuroengineering is a discipline that uses engineering techniques to understand repair replace or enhance neural systems neural engineers are uniquely qualified to solve design problems at the interface of living neural tissue and non-living constructs pharmaceutical engineering pharmaceutical engineering is an interdisciplinary science that includes drug engineering novel drug delivery and targeting pharmaceutical technology unit operations of chemical engineering and pharmaceutical analysis it may be deemed as a part of pharmacy due to its focus on the use of technology on chemical agents in providing better medicinal treatment the ispe is an international body that certifies this now rapidly emerging interdisciplinary science medical devices main articles medical devices medical equipment and medical technology this is an extremely broad categoryessentially covering all health care products that do not achieve their intended results through predominantly chemical eg pharmaceuticals or biological eg vaccines means and do not involve metabolism a medical device is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease some examples include pacemakers infusion pumps the heart-lung machine dialysis machines artificial organs implants artificial limbs corrective lenses cochlear implants ocular prosthetics facial prosthetics somato prosthetics and dental implants stereolithography is a practical example of medical modeling being used to create physical objects beyond modeling organs and the human body emerging engineering techniques are also currently used in the research and development of new devices for innovative therapies treatments patient monitoring of complex diseases medical devices are regulated and classified in the us as follows see also regulation class i devices present minimal potential for harm to the user and are often simpler in design than class ii or class iii devices devices in this category include tongue depressors bedpans elastic bandages examination gloves and hand-held surgical instruments and other similar types of common equipment class ii devices are subject to special controls in addition to the general controls of class i devices special controls may include special labeling requirements mandatory performance standards and postmarket surveillance devices in this class are typically non-invasive and include x-ray machines pacs powered wheelchairs infusion pumps and surgical drapes class iii devices generally require premarket approval pma or premarket notification 510k a scientific review to ensure the devices safety and effectiveness in addition to the general controls of class i examples include replacement heart valves hip and knee joint implants silicone gel-filled breast implants implanted cerebellar stimulators implantable pacemaker pulse generators and endosseous intra-bone implants medical imaging main article medical imaging medicalbiomedical imaging is a major segment of medical devices this area deals with enabling clinicians to directly or indirectly view things not visible in plain sight such as due to their size andor location this can involve utilizing ultrasound magnetism uv radiology and other means imaging technologies are often essential to medical diagnosis and are typically the most complex equipment found in a hospital including fluoroscopy magnetic resonance imaging mri nuclear medicine positron emission tomography pet pet-ct scans projection radiography such as x-rays and ct scans tomography ultrasound optical microscopy and electron microscopy implants an implant is a kind of medical device made to replace and act as a missing biological structure as compared with a transplant which indicates transplanted biomedical tissue the surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium silicone or apatite depending on what is the most functional in some cases implants contain electronics eg artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants some implants are bioactive such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or drug-eluting stents bionics further information bionics in medicine artificial body part replacements are one of the many applications of bionics concerned with the intricate and thorough study of the properties and function of human body systems bionics may be applied to solve some engineering problems careful study of the different functions and processes of the eyes ears and other organs paved the way for improved cameras television radio transmitters and receivers and many other useful tools these developments have indeed made our lives better but the best contribution that bionics has made is in the field of biomedical engineering the building of useful replacements for various parts of the human body modern hospitals now have available spare parts to replace body parts badly damaged by injury or disease biomedical engineers work hand in hand with doctors to build these artificial body parts clinical engineering main article clinical engineering clinical engineering is the branch of biomedical engineering dealing with the actual implementation of medical equipment and technologies in hospitals or other clinical settings major roles of clinical engineers include training and supervising biomedical equipment technicians bmets selecting technological productsservices and logistically managing their implementation working with governmental regulators on inspectionsaudits and serving as technological consultants for other hospital staff eg physicians administrators it etc clinical engineers also advise and collaborate with medical device producers regarding prospective design improvements based on clinical experiences as well as monitor the progression of the state of the art so as to redirect procurement patterns accordingly their inherent focus on practical implementation of technology has tended to keep them oriented more towards incremental-level redesigns and reconfigurations as opposed to revolutionary research development or ideas that would be many years from clinical adoption however there is a growing effort to expand this time-horizon over which clinical engineers can influence the trajectory of biomedical innovation in their various roles they form a bridge between the primary designers and the end-users by combining the perspectives of being both 1 close to the point-of-use while 2 trained in product and process engineering clinical engineering departments will sometimes hire not just biomedical engineers but also industrialsystems engineers to help address operations researchoptimization human factors cost analysis etc also see safety engineering for a discussion of the procedures used to design safe systems rehabilitation engineering main article rehabilitation engineering rehabilitation engineering is the systematic application of engineering sciences to design develop adapt test evaluate apply and distribute technological solutions to problems confronted by individuals with disabilities functional areas addressed through rehabilitation engineering may include mobility communications hearing vision and cognition and activities associated with employment independent living education and integration into the community while some rehabilitation engineers have masters degrees in rehabilitation engineering usually a subspecialty of biomedical engineering most rehabilitation engineers have undergraduate or graduate degrees in biomedical engineering mechanical engineering or electrical engineering a portuguese university provides an undergraduate degree and a masters degree in rehabilitation engineering and accessibility qualification to become a rehab engineer in the uk is possible via a university bsc honours degree course such as health design technology institute coventry university the rehabilitation process for people with disabilities often entails the design of assistive devices such as walking aids intended to promote inclusion of their users into the mainstream of society commerce and recreation regulatory issues regulatory issues have been constantly increased in the last decades to respond to the many incidents caused by devices to patients for example from 2008 to 2011 in us there were 119 fda recalls of medical devices classified as class i according to us food and drug administration fda class i recall is associated to a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death regardless of the country-specific legislation the main regulatory objectives coincide worldwide for example in the medical device regulations a product must be 1 safe and 2 effective and 3 for all the manufactured devices a product is safe if patients users and third parties do not run unacceptable risks of physical hazards death injuries in its intended use protective measures have to be introduced on the devices to reduce residual risks at acceptable level if compared with the benefit derived from the use of it a product is effective if it performs as specified by the manufacturer in the intended use effectiveness is achieved through clinical evaluation compliance to performance standards or demonstrations of substantial equivalence with an already marketed device the previous features have to be ensured for all the manufactured items of the medical device this requires that a quality system shall be in place for all the relevant entities and processes that may impact safety and effectiveness over the whole medical device lifecyle the medical device engineering area is among the most heavily regulated fields of engineering and practicing biomedical engineers must routinely consult and cooperate with regulatory law attorneys and other experts the food and drug administration fda is the principal healthcare regulatory authority in the united states having jurisdiction over medical devices drugs biologics and combination products the paramount objectives driving policy decisions by the fda are safety and effectiveness of healthcare products that have to be assured through a quality system in place as specified under 21 cfr 829 regulation in addition because biomedical engineers often develop devices and technologies for consumer use such as physical therapy devices which are also medical devices these may also be governed in some respects by the consumer product safety commission the greatest hurdles tend to be 510k clearance typically for class 2 devices or pre-market approval typically for drugs and class 3 devices in the european context safety effectiveness and quality is ensured through the conformity assessment that is defined as the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies with the requirements of the european medical device directive the directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple declaration of conformity annex vii for class i devices to ec verification annex iv production quality assurance annex v product quality assurance annex vi and full quality assurance annex ii the medical device directive specifies detailed procedures for certification in general terms these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file the technical file and the quality system deliveries the risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients for the use of the device the technical file contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification fda technical file has similar content although organized in different structure the quality system deliverables usually includes procedures that ensure quality throughout all product life cycle the same standard iso en 13485 is usually applied for quality management systems in us and worldwide in the european union there are certifying entities named notified bodies accredited by european member states the notified bodies must ensure the effectiveness of the certification process for all medical devices apart from the class i devices where a declaration of conformity produced by the manufacturer is sufficient for marketing once a product has passed all the steps required by the medical device directive the device is entitled to bear a ce marking indicating that the device is believed to be safe and effective when used as intended and therefore it can be marketed within the european union area the different regulatory arrangements sometimes result in particular technologies being developed first for either the us or in europe depending on the more favorable form of regulation while nations often strive for substantive harmony to facilitate cross-national distribution philosophical differences about the optimal extent of regulation can be a hindrance more restrictive regulations seem appealing on an intuitive level but critics decry the tradeoff cost in terms of slowing access to life-saving developments rohs ii directive 2011/65eu better known as rohs 2 is a recast of legislation originally introduced in 2002 the original eu legislation restrictions of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronics devices rohs directive 2002/95ec was replaced and superseded by 2011/65eu published in july 2011 and commonly known as rohs 2 rohs seeks to limit the dangerous substances in circulation in electronics products in particular toxins and heavy metals which are subsequently released into the environment when such devices are recycled the scope of rohs 2 is widened to include products previously excluded such as medical devices and industrial equipment in addition manufacturers are now obliged to provide conformity risk assessments and test reports - or explain why they are lacking for the first time not only manufacturers but also importers and distributors share a responsibility to ensure electrical and electronic equipment within the scope of rohs comply with the hazardous substances limits and have a ce mark on their products iec 60601 the new international standard iec 60601 for home healthcare electro-medical devices defining the requirements for devices used in the home healthcare environment iec 60601-1-11 2010 must now be incorporated into the design and verification of a wide range of home use and point of care medical devices along with other applicable standards in the iec 60601 3rd edition series the mandatory date for implementation of the en european version of the standard is june 1 2013 the us fda requires the use of the standard on june 30 2013 while health canada recently extended the required date from june 2012 to april 2013 the north american agencies will only require these standards for new device submissions while the eu will take the more severe approach of requiring all applicable devices being placed on the market to consider the home healthcare standard training and certification education biomedical engineers require considerable knowledge of both engineering and biology and typically have a masters ms mtech mse or meng or a doctoral phd degree in bme biomedical engineering or another branch of engineering with considerable potential for bme overlap as interest in bme increases many engineering colleges now have a biomedical engineering department or program with offerings ranging from the undergraduate btechbs beng or bse to doctoral levels biomedical engineering has only recently been emerging as its own discipline rather than a cross-disciplinary hybrid specialization of other disciplines and bme programs at all levels are becoming more widespread including the bachelor of science in biomedical engineering which actually includes so much biological science content that many students use it as a pre-med major in preparation for medical school the number of biomedical engineers is expected to rise as both a cause and effect of improvements in medical technology in the us an increasing number of undergraduate programs are also becoming recognized by abet as accredited bioengineeringbiomedical engineering programs over 65 programs are currently accredited by abet case western reserve created the first mdphd program in 1969 to develop engineers with a physicians perspective in canada and australia accredited graduate programs in biomedical engineering are common for example in universities such as mcmaster university and the first canadian undergraduate bme program at ryerson university offering a four-year beng program the polytechnique in montreal is also offering a bachelorss degree in biomedical engineering as with many degrees the reputation and ranking of a program may factor into the desirability of a degree holder for either employment or graduate admission the reputation of many undergraduate degrees are also linked to the institutions graduate or research programs which have some tangible factors for rating such as research funding and volume publications and citations with bme specifically the ranking of a universitys hospital and medical school can also be a significant factor in the perceived prestige of its bme departmentprogram graduate education is a particularly important aspect in bme while many engineering fields such as mechanical or electrical engineering do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field the majority of bme positions do prefer or even require them since most bme-related professions involve scientific research such as in pharmaceutical and medical device development graduate education is almost a requirement as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience this can be either a masters or doctoral level degree while in certain specialties a phd is notably more common than in others it is hardly ever the majority except in academia in fact the perceived need for some kind of graduate credential is so strong that some undergraduate bme programs will actively discourage students from majoring in bme without an expressed intention to also obtain a masters degree or apply to medical school afterwards graduate programs in bme like in other scientific fields are highly varied and particular programs may emphasize certain aspects within the field they may also feature extensive collaborative efforts with programs in other fields such as the universitys medical school or other engineering divisions owing again to the interdisciplinary nature of bme ms and phd programs will typically require applicants to have an undergraduate degree in bme or another engineering discipline plus certain life science coursework or life science plus certain engineering coursework education in bme also varies greatly around the world by virtue of its extensive biotechnology sector its numerous major universities and relatively few internal barriers the us has progressed a great deal in its development of bme education and training opportunities europe which also has a large biotechnology sector and an impressive education system has encountered trouble in creating uniform standards as the european community attempts to supplant some of the national jurisdictional barriers that still exist recently initiatives such as biomedea have sprung up to develop bme-related education and professional standards other countries such as australia are recognizing and moving to correct deficiencies in their bme education also as high technology endeavors are usually marks of developed nations some areas of the world are prone to slower development in education including in bme licensurecertification see also professional engineer engineering licensure in the us is largely optional and rarely specified by branchdiscipline as with other learned professions each state has certain fairly similar requirements for becoming licensed as a registered professional engineer pe but in practice such a license is not required to practice in the majority of situations due to an exception known as the private industry exemption which effectively applies to the vast majority of american engineers this is notably not the case in many other countries where a license is as legally necessary to practice engineering as it is for law or medicine biomedical engineering is regulated in some countries such as australia but registration is typically only recommended and not required in the uk mechanical engineers working in the areas of medical engineering bioengineering or biomedical engineering can gain chartered engineer status through the institution of mechanical engineers the institution also runs the engineering in medicine and health division the institute of physics and engineering in medicine ipem has a panel for the accreditation of msc courses in biomedical engineering and chartered engineering status can also be sought through ipem the fundamentals of engineering exam - the first and more general of two licensure examinations for most us jurisdictionsdoes now cover biology although technically not bme for the second exam called the principles and practices part 2 or the professional engineering exam candidates may select a particular engineering disciplines content to be tested on there is currently not an option for bme with this meaning that any biomedical engineers seeking a license must prepare to take this examination in another category which does not affect the actual license since most jurisdictions do not recognize discipline specialties anyway however the biomedical engineering society bmes is as of 2009 exploring the possibility of seeking to implement a bme-specific version of this exam to facilitate biomedical engineers pursuing licensure beyond governmental registration certain private-sector professionalindustrial organizations also offer certifications with varying degrees of prominence one such example is the certified clinical engineer cce certification for clinical engineers career prospects in 2012 there were about 19,400 biomedical engineers employed in the us and the field was predicted to grow by 27% much faster than average from 2012-2022 biomedical engineering has the highest percentage of women engineers compared to other common engineering professions
