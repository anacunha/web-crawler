genetic use restriction technology terminator gene redirects here for dna transcription terminators see terminator genetics genetic use restriction technology gurt colloquially known as terminator technology or suicide seeds is the name given to proposed methods for restricting the use of genetically modified plants by causing second generation seeds to be sterile the technology was developed under a cooperative research and development agreement between the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture and delta and pine land company in the 1990s but it is not yet commercially available the technology was discussed during the 8th conference of the parties to the united nations convention on biological diversity in curitiba brazil march 20-31 2006 variants there are conceptually two types of gurt variety-level genetic use restriction technologies v-gurts this type of gurt produces sterile seeds so the seed from this crop could not be used as seeds but only for sale as food or fodder this would not have an immediate impact on the large number of primarily western farmers who use hybrid seeds as they do not produce their own planting seeds and instead buy specialized hybrid seeds from seed production companies however currently around 80 percent of farmers in both brazil and pakistan grow crops based on saved seeds from previous harvests consequentially resistance to the introduction of gurt technology into developing countries is strong the technology is restricted at the plant variety level hence the term v-gurt manufacturers of genetically enhanced crops would use this technology to protect their products from unauthorised use t-gurt a second type of gurt modifies a crop in such a way that the genetic enhancement engineered into the crop does not function until the crop plant is treated with a chemical that is sold by the biotechnology company farmers can save seeds for use each year however they do not get to use the enhanced trait in the crop unless they purchase the activator compound the technology is restricted at the trait level hence the term t-gurt opposition terminator seeds were initially developed as a concept by the united states department of agriculture and multinational seed companies as of 2006 they had not been commercialized anywhere in the world due to opposition from farmers indigenous peoples ngos and some governments in 2000 the united nations convention on biological diversity recommended a de facto moratorium on field-testing and commercial sale of terminator seeds the moratorium was re-affirmed and the language strengthened in march 2006 at the cop8 meeting of the uncbd india and brazil have passed national laws to prohibit the technology potential uses where effective intellectual monopoly specifically biological patents doesnt exist or is not enforced gurts could be an alternative to stimulate plant developing activities by biotech firms non-viable seeds produced on v-gurt plants may reduce the propagation of volunteer plants volunteer plants can become an economic problem for larger-scale mechanized farming systems that incorporate crop rotation under warm wet harvest conditions non v-gurt grain can sprout which lowers the quality of grain produced it is likely that this problem would not occur with the use of v-gurt grain varieties use of v-gurt technology could prevent escape of transgenes into wild relatives and prevent any impact on biodiversity crops modified to produce non-food products could be armed with gurt technology to prevent accidental transmission of these traits into crops destined for foods
