educational technology e-learning redirects here it is not to be confused with online machine learning educational technology is defined by the association for educational communications and technology as the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources educational technology refers to the use of both physical hardware and educational theoretics it encompasses several domains including learning theory computer-based training online learning and where mobile technologies are used m-learning accordingly there are several discrete aspects to describing the intellectual and technical development of educational technology educational technology as the theory and practice of educational approaches to learning educational technology as technological tools and media that assist in the communication of knowledge and its development and exchange educational technology for learning management systems lms such as tools for student and curriculum management and education management information systems emis educational technology itself as an educational subject such courses may be called computer studies or information and communication technology ict definition richey defined educational technology as the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources the association for educational communications and technology aect denoted instructional technology as the theory and practice of design development utilization management and evaluation of processes and resources for learning as such educational technology refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences such as equipment as well as processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research and in a given context may refer to theoretical algorithmic or heuristic processes it does not necessarily imply physical technology related terms educational technology is an inclusive term for the tools and the theoretical foundations for supporting learning and teaching educational technology is not restricted to high technology however modern electronic educational technology is an important part of society today educational technology encompasses e-learning instructional technology information and communication technology ict in education edtech learning technology multimedia learning technology-enhanced learning tel computer-based instruction

education digital educational collaboration distributed learning computer-mediated communication cyber-learning and multi-modal instruction virtual education personal learning environments networked learning virtual learning environments vle which are also called learning platforms m-learning and digital education each of these numerous terms has had its advocates who point up potential distinctive features however moore sees these various terminologies as emphasizing particular features such as digitization approaches components or delivery methods rather than being fundamentally dissimilar in concept or principle for example m-learning emphasizes mobility which may allow for altered timing location accessibility and context of learning nevertheless its purpose and conceptual principles are those of educational technology in practice as technology has advanced the particular narrowly defined aspect that was initially emphasized by name has blended into the general field of educational technology as a further example virtual learning in a narrowly defined semantic sense implies entering the environmental simulation within a virtual world for example in treating posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd in practice a virtual education course refers to any instructional course in which all or at least a significant portion is delivered by the internet virtual is used in that broader way to describe a course that is not taught in a classroom face-to-face but through a substitute mode that can conceptually be associated virtually with classroom teaching which means that people do not have to go to the physical classroom to learn accordingly virtual education refers to a form of distance learning in which course content is delivered by various methods such as course management applications multimedia resources and videoconferencing bernard luskin an educational technology pioneer advocated that the e of e-learning should be interpreted to mean exciting energetic enthusiastic emotional extended excellent and educational in addition to electronic parks suggested that the e should refer to everything everyone engaging easy these broad interpretations focus on new applications and developments as well as learning theory and media psychology history main article educational software helping people learn in ways that are easier faster surer or less expensive can be traced back to the emergence of very early tools such as paintings on cave walls various types of abacus have been used writing slates and blackboards have been used for at least a millennium from their introduction books and pamphlets have held a prominent role in education from the early twentieth century duplicating machines such as the mimeograph and gestetner stencil devices were used to produce short copy runs typically 10-50 copies for classroom or home use the use of media for instructional purposes is generally traced back to the first decade of the 20th century with the introduction of educational films 1900s and sidney presseys mechanical teaching machines 1920s the first all multiple choice large scale assessment was the army alpha used to assess the intelligence and more specifically the aptitudes of world war i military recruits further large-scale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after wwii using films and other mediated materials such as overhead projectors the concept of hypertext is traced to description of memex by vannevar bush in 1945 slide projectors were widely used during the 1950s in educational institutional settings cuisenaire rods were devised in the 1920s and saw widespread use from the late 1950s in 1960 the university of illinois initiated a classroom system based in linked computer terminals where students could access informational resources on a particular course while listening to the lectures that were recorded via some form of remotely linked device like a television or audio device in the mid 1960s stanford university psychology professors patrick suppes and richard c atkinson experimented with using computers to teach arithmetic and spelling via teletypes to elementary school students in the palo alto unified school district in california stanfords education program for gifted youth is descended from those early experiments in 1963 bernard luskin installed the first computer in a community college for instruction working with stanford and others he helped develop computer-assisted instruction working with the rand corporation luskins landmark ucla dissertation in 1970 analyzed obstacles to computer-assisted instruction in 1971 ivan illich published a hugely influential book called deschooling society in which he envisioned learning webs as a model for people to network the learning they needed the 1970s and 1980s saw notable contributions in computer-based learning by murray turoff and starr roxanne hiltz at the new jersey institute of technology as well as developments at the university of guelph in canada in 1976 bernard luskin launched coastline community college as a college without walls using television station koce-tv as a vehicle in the uk the council for educational technology supported the use of educational technology in particular administering the governments national development programme in computer aided learning 1973-77 and the microelectronics education programme 1980-86 by the mid-1980s accessing course content became possible at many college libraries in computer-based training cbt or computer-based learning cbl the learning interaction was between the student and computer drills or micro-world simulations digitized communication and networking in education started in the mid-1980s educational institutions began to take advantage of the new medium by offering distance learning courses using computer networking for information early e-learning systems based on computer-based learningtraining often replicated autocratic teaching styles whereby the role of the e-learning system was assumed to be for transferring knowledge as opposed to systems developed later based on computer supported collaborative learning cscl which encouraged the shared development of knowledge videoconferencing was an important forerunner to the educational technologies known today this work was especially popular with museum education even in recent years videoconferencing has risen in popularity to reach over 20,000 students across the united states and canada in 2008-2009 disadvantages of this form of educational technology are readily apparent image and sound quality is often grainy or pixelated videoconferencing requires setting up a type of mini-television studio within the museum for broadcast space becomes an issue and specialised equipment is required for both the provider and the participant the open university in britain and the university of british columbia where web ct now incorporated into blackboard inc was first developed began a revolution of using the internet to deliver learning making heavy use of web-based training online distance learning and online discussion between students practitioners such as harasim 1995 put heavy emphasis on the use of learning networks with the advent of world wide web in the 1990s teachers embarked on the method using emerging technologies to employ multi-object oriented sites which are text-based online virtual reality systems to create course websites along with simple sets of instructions for its students by 1994 the first online high school had been founded in 1997 graziadei described criteria for evaluating products and developing technology-based courses that include being portable replicable scalable affordable and having a high probability of long-term cost-effectiveness improved internet functionality enabled new schemes of communication with multimedia or webcams the national center for education statistics estimate the number of k-12 students enrolled in online distance learning programs increased by 65 percent from 2002 to 2005 with greater flexibility ease of communication between teacher and student and quick lecture and assignment feedback according to a 2008 study conducted by the us department of education during the 2006-2007 academic year about 66% of postsecondary public and private schools participating in student financial aid programs offered some distance learning courses records show 77% of enrollment in for-credit courses with an online component in 2008 the council of europe passed a statement endorsing e-learnings potential to drive equality and education improvements across the eu computer-mediated communication cmc is between learners and instructors mediated by the computer in contrast cbtcbl usually means individualized self-study learning while cmc involves educatortutor facilitation and requires scenarization of flexible learning activities in addition modern ict provides education with tools for sustaining learning communities and associated knowledge management tasks students growing up in this digital age have extensive exposure to a variety of media major high-tech companies such as google verizon and microsoft have funded schools to provide them the ability to teach their students through technology in the hope that this would lead to improved student performance theory main articles educational psychology e-learning theory learning theory education and educational philosophies various pedagogical perspectives or learning theories may be considered in designing and interacting with educational technology e-learning theory examines these approaches these theoretical perspectives are grouped into three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks behaviorism cognitivism and constructivism behaviorism this theoretical framework was developed in the early 20th century based on animal learning experiments by ivan pavlov edward thorndike edward c tolman clark l hull and bf skinner many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning but modern educators generally see behaviorism as one aspect of a holistic synthesis bf skinner wrote extensively on improvements of teaching based on his functional analysis of verbal behavior and wrote the technology of teaching an attempt to dispel the myths underlying contemporary education as well as promote his system he called programmed instruction ogden lindsley developed a learning system named celeration that was based on behavior analysis but that substantially differed from kellers and skinners models cognitivism cognitive science underwent significant change in the 1960s and 1970s while retaining the empirical framework of behaviorism cognitive psychology theories look beyond behavior to explain brain-based learning by considering how human memory works to promote learning the atkinson-shiffrin memory model and baddeleys working memory model were established as theoretical frameworks computer science and information technology have had a major influence on cognitive science theory the cognitive concepts of working memory formerly known as short term memory and long term memory have been facilitated by research and technology from the field of computer science another major influence on the field of cognitive science is noam chomsky today researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load information processing and media psychology these theoretical perspectives influence instructional design constructivism educational psychologists distinguish between several types of constructivism individual or psychological constructivism such as piagets theory of cognitive development and social constructivism this form of constructivism has a primary focus on how learners construct their own meaning from new information as they interact with reality and with other learners who bring different perspectives constructivist learning environments require students to use their prior knowledge and experiences to formulate new related andor adaptive concepts in learning termos 2012 under this framework the role of the teacher becomes that of a facilitator providing guidance so that learners can construct their own knowledge constructivist educators must make sure that the prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught jonassen 1997 suggests well-structured learning environments are useful for novice learners and that ill-structured environments are only useful for more advanced learners educators utilizing a constructivist perspective may emphasize an active learning environment that may incorporate learner centered problem based learning project-based learning and inquiry-based learning ideally involving real-world scenarios in which students are actively engaged in critical thinking activities an illustrative discussion and example can be found in the 1980s deployment of constructivist cognitive learning in computer literacy which involved programming as an instrument of learning logo a programming language embodied an attempt to integrate piagetan ideas with computers and technology initially there were broad hopeful claims including perhaps the most controversial claim that it would improve general problem-solving skills across disciplines however logo programming skills did not consistently yield cognitive benefits it was not as concrete as advocates claimed it privileged one form of reasoning over all others and it was difficult to apply the thinking activity to non-logo based activities by the late 1980s logo and other similar programming languages had lost their novelty and dominance and were gradually de-emphasized amid criticisms practice main article instructional design the extent to which e-learning assists or replaces other learning and teaching approaches is variable ranging on a continuum from none to fully online distance learning a variety of descriptive terms have been employed somewhat inconsistently to categorize the extent to which technology is used for example hybrid learning or blended learning may refer to classroom aids and laptops or may refer to approaches in which traditional classroom time is reduced but not eliminated and is replaced with some online learning distributed learning may describe either the e-learning component of a hybrid approach or fully online distance learning environments synchronous and asynchronous e-learning may either be synchronous or asynchronous synchronous learning occurs in real-time with all participants interacting at the same time while asynchronous learning is self-paced and allows participants to engage in the exchange of ideas or information without the dependency of other participants involvement at the same time synchronous learning refers to the exchange of ideas and information with one or more participants during the same period examples are face-to-face discussion online real-time live teacher instruction and feedback skype conversations and chat rooms or virtual classrooms where everyone is online and working collaboratively at the same time since students are working collaboratively synchronized learning helps students create an open mind because they have to listen and learn from their peers synchronized learning fosters online awareness and improves many students writing skills asynchronous learning may use technologies such as email blogs wikis and discussion boards as well as web-supported textbooks hypertext documents audio video courses and social networking using web 2.0 at the professional educational level training may include virtual operating rooms asynchronous learning is beneficial for students who have health problems or who have child care responsibilities they have the opportunity to complete their work in a low stress environment and within a more flexible time frame in asynchronous online courses students proceed at their own pace if they need to listen to a lecture a second time or think about a question for a while they may do so without fearing that they will hold back the rest of the class through online courses students can earn their diplomas more quickly or repeat failed courses without the embarrassment of being in a class with younger students students have access to an incredible variety of enrichment courses in online learning and can participate in college courses internships sports or work and still graduate with their class on the other hand the technological convergence of the mass media is the result of a long adaptation process of their communicative resources to the evolutionary changes of each historical moment thus the new media became plurally an extension of the traditional media on the cyberspace allowing to the public access information in a wide range of digital devices in other words it is a cultural virtualization of human reality as a result of the migration from physical to virtual space mediated by the icts ruled by codes signs and particular social relationships inside and outside classroom forwards arise instant ways of synchronous and asynchronous communication interaction and possible quick access to information in which we are no longer mere senders but also producers reproducers co-workers and providers new technologies also help to connect people from different cultures outside the virtual space what was unthinkable fifty years ago in this giant relationships web we mutually absorb each others beliefs customs education values laws and habits cultural legacies perpetuated by a physical-virtual dynamics in constant metamorphosis ibidem linear learning computer-based training cbt refers to self-paced learning activities delivered on a computer or handheld device such as a tablet or smartphone cbt initially delivered content via cd-rom and typically presented content linearly much like reading an online book or manual for this reason cbt is often used to teach static processes such as using software or completing mathematical equations computer-based training is conceptually similar to web-based training wbt which are delivered via internet using a web browser assessing learning in a cbt is often by assessments that can be easily scored by a computer such as multiple choice questions drag-and-drop radio button simulation or other interactive means assessments are easily scored and recorded via online software providing immediate end-user feedback and completion status users are often able to print completion records in the form of certificates cbts provide learning stimulus beyond traditional learning methodology from textbook manual or classroom-based instruction cbts can be a good alternative to printed learning materials since rich media including videos or animations can be embedded to enhance the learning however cbts pose some learning challenges typically the creation of effective cbts requires enormous resources the software for developing cbts such as flash or adobe director is often more complex than a subject matter expert or teacher is able to use the lack of human interaction can limit both the type of content that can be presented and the type of assessment that can be performed and may need supplementation with online discussion or other interactive elements collaborative learning computer-supported collaborative learning cscl uses instructional methods designed to encourage or require students to work together on learning tasks cscl is similar in concept to the terminology e-learning 2.0 and networked collaborative learning ncl collaborative learning is distinguishable from the traditional approach to instruction in which the instructor is the principal source of knowledge and skills for example the neologism e-learning 1.0 refers to the direct transfer method in computer-based learning and training systems cbl in contrast to the linear delivery of content often directly from the instructors material cscl uses blogs wikis and cloud-based document portals such as google docs and dropbox with technological web 2.0 advances sharing information between multiple people in a network has become much easier and use has increased one of the main reasons for its usage states that it is a breeding ground for creative and engaging educational endeavors using web 2.0 social tools in the classroom allows for students and teachers to work collaboratively discuss ideas and promote information according to sendall 2008 blogs wikis and social networking skills are found to be significantly useful in the classroom after initial instruction on using the tools students reported an increase in knowledge and comfort level for using web 2.0 tools the collaborative tools prepare students with technology skills necessary in todays workforce locus of control remains an important consideration in successful engagement of e-learners according to the work of cassandra b whyte the continuing attention to aspects of motivation and success in regard to e-learning should be kept in context and concert with other educational efforts information about motivational tendencies can help educators psychologists and technologists develop insights to help students perform better academically another type of study aid is collaborative apps that allow students and teachers to interact while studying an example is mathchat which allows cooperative problem solving and answer feedback some apps can also provide an opportunity to revise or learn new topics independently in a simulated classroom environment a popular example is khan academy which offers material in math biology chemistry economics art history and many others it has the advantage of blending learning styles as the app offers many videos for visual and auditory learners as well as exercises and tasks to solve for the kinesthetic learners other apps are designed after games which provide a fun way to revise when the experience is enjoyable the students become more engaged games also usually come with a sense of progression which can help keep students motivated and consistent while trying to improve examples of educational games are dragon box mind snacks code spells and many more classroom 2.0 classroom 2.0 refers to online multi-user virtual environments muves that connect schools across geographical frontiers known as etwinning computer-supported collaborative learning cscl allows learners in one school to communicate with learners in another that they would not get to know otherwise enhancing educational outcomescitation needed and cultural integration examples of classroom 2.0 applications are blogger and skype e-learning 2.0 main article computer-supported collaborative learning e-learning 2.0 is a type of computer-supported collaborative learning cscl system that developed with the emergence of web 2.0 from an e-learning 2.0 perspective conventional e-learning systems were based on instructional packets which were delivered to students using assignments assignments were evaluated by the teacher in contrast the new e-learning places increased emphasis on social learning and use of social software such as blogs social media wikis podcasts discussion groups and virtual worlds such as second life this phenomenon has been referred to as long tail learning e-learning 2.0 in contrast to e-learning systems not based on cscl assumes that knowledge as meaning and understanding is socially constructed learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others in addition to virtual classroom environments social networks have become an important part of e-learning 2.0 social networks have been used to foster online learning communities around subjects as diverse as test preparation and language education mobile assisted language learning mall is the use of handheld computers or cell phones to assist in language learning traditional educators may not promote social networking unless they are communicating with their own colleagues virtual learning environments vles and personal learning environments ples provide an easy to use system for flexibly delivering learning materials activities and support to students across an institution for the administrator a vle provides a set of tools which allows course content and students to be managed efficiently and provide a single point of integration with student record systems media educational media and tools can be used for task structuring support help with how to do a task procedures and processes access to knowledge bases help user find information needed alternate forms of knowledge representation multiple representations of knowledge eg video audio text image data numerous types of physical technology are currently used digital cameras video cameras interactive whiteboard tools document cameras electronic media and lcd projectors combinations of these techniques include blogs collaborative software eportfolios and virtual classrooms audio and video radio offers a synchronous educational vehicle while streaming audio over the internet with webcasts and podcasts can be asynchronous classroom microphones often wireless can enable learners and educators to interact more clearly video technology has included vhs tapes and dvds as well as on-demand and synchronous methods with digital video via server or web-based options such as streamed video from youtube teacher tube skype adobe connect and webcams telecommuting can connect with speakers and other experts interactive digital video games are being used at k-12 and higher education institutions computers tablets and mobile devices collaborative learning is a group-based learning approach in which learners are mutually engaged in a coordinated fashion to achieve a learning goal or complete a learning task with recent developments in smartphone technology the processing powers and storage capabilities of modern mobiles allow for advanced development and use of apps many app developers and education experts have been exploring smartphone and tablet apps as a medium for collaborative learning computers and tablets enable learners and educators to access websites as well as programs such as microsoft word powerpoint pdf files and images many mobile devices support m-learning mobile devices such as clickers and smartphones can be used for interactive audience response feedback mobile learning can provide performance support for checking the time setting reminders retrieving worksheets and instruction manuals opencourseware ocw gives free public access to information used in undergraduate and graduate programs participating institutions are mit and harvard princeton stanford university of pennsylvania and university of michigan social networks group webpages blogs wikis and twitter allow learners and educators to post thoughts ideas and comments on a website in an interactive learning environment social networking sites are virtual communities for people interested in a particular subject to communicate by voice chat instant message video conference or blogs the national school boards association found that 96% of students with online access have used social networking technologies and more than 50% talk online about schoolwork social networking encourages collaboration and engagement and can be a motivational tool for self-efficacy amongst students every student has his or her own learning requirements and a web 2.0 educational framework provides enough resources learning styles communication tools and flexibility to accommodate this diversity webcams webcams and webcasting have enabled creation of virtual classrooms and virtual learning environment webcams are also being used to counter plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty that might occur in an e-learning environment whiteboards whiteboards predate tablets and other technological tools but current interactive whiteboards and smartboards allow learners and instructors to write on the touch screen the screen markup can be on either a blank whiteboard or any computer screen content depending on permission settings this visual learning can be interactive and participatory including writing and manipulating images on the interactive whiteboard screencasting screencasting allows users to share their screens directly from their browser and make the video available online so that other viewers can stream the video directly the presenter thus has the ability to show their ideas and flow of thoughts rather than simply explain them as simple text content in combination with audio and video the educator can mimic the one-on-one experience of the classroom and deliver clear complete instructions learners have an ability to pause and rewind to review at their own pace something a classroom cannot always offer virtual classroom main articles virtual learning environment and muve a virtual learning environment vle also known as a learning platform simulates a virtual classroom or meetings by simultaneously mixing several communication technologies for example web conferencing software such as gototraining webex training or adobe connect enables students and instructors to communicate with each other via webcam microphone and real-time chatting in a group setting participants can raise hands answer polls or take tests students are able to whiteboard and screencast when given rights by the instructor who sets permission levels for text notes microphone rights and mouse control a virtual classroom provides the opportunity for students to receive direct instruction from a qualified teacher in an interactive environment learners can have direct and immediate access to their instructor for instant feedback and direction the virtual classroom provides a structured schedule of classes which can be helpful for students who may find the freedom of asynchronous learning to be overwhelming in addition the virtual classroom provides a social learning environment that replicates the traditional brick and mortar classroom most virtual classroom applications provide a recording feature each class is recorded and stored on a server which allows for instant playback of any class over the course of the school year this can be extremely useful for students to retrieve missed material or review concepts for an upcoming exam parents and auditors have the conceptual ability to monitor any classroom to ensure that they are satisfied with the education the learner is receiving in higher education especially a virtual learning environment vle is sometimes combined with a management information system mis to create a managed learning environment in which all aspects of a course are handled through a consistent user interface throughout the institution physical universities and newer online-only colleges offer select academic degrees and certificate programs via the internet some programs require students to attend some campus classes or orientations but many are delivered completely online several universities offer online student support services such as online advising and registration e-counseling online textbook purchases student governments and student newspapers augmented reality ar provides students and teachers the opportunity to create layers of digital information that includes both virtual world and real world elements to interact with in real time there are already a variety of apps which offer a lot of variations and possibilities e-learning authoring tools e-learning authoring tools are software or online services that enable users to create courses simulations or other educational experiences these tools typically support conventional presentation-like courses and may enable screen recording multimedia interactivity quizzes and non-linear or adaptive approaches learning management system main article learning management system a learning management system lms is software used for delivering tracking and managing training and education for example an lms tracks attendance time on task and student progress educators can post announcements grade assignments check on course activity and participate in class discussions students can submit their work read and respond to discussion questions and take quizzes an lms may allow teachers administrators students and permitted additional parties such as parents if appropriate to track various metrics lmss range from systems for managing trainingeducational records to software for distributing courses over the internet and offering features for online collaboration the creation and maintenance of comprehensive learning content requires substantial initial and ongoing investments of human labor effective translation into other languages and cultural contexts requires even more investment by knowledgeable personnel internet-based learning management systems include canvas blackboard inc and moodle these types of lms allow educators to run a learning system partially or fully online asynchronously or synchronously blackboard can be used for k-12 education higher education business and government collaboration moodle is a free-to-download open source course management system that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for distance learning courses eliademy is a free cloud based course management system that provides blended learning opportunities as well as platforms for distance learning courses learning content management system a learning content management system lcms is software for author content courses reusable content objects an lcms may be solely dedicated to producing and publishing content that is hosted on an lms or it can host the content itself the aviation industry computer-based training committee aicc specification provides support for content that is hosted separately from the lms a recent trend in lcmss is to address this issue through crowdsourcing cfslidewiki computer-aided assessment computer-aided assessment e-assessment ranges from automated multiple-choice tests to more sophisticated systems with some systems feedback can be geared towards a students specific mistakes or the computer can navigate the student through a series of questions adapting to what the student appears to have learned or not learned formative assessment sifts out the incorrect answers and these questions are then explained by the teacher the learner then practices with slight variations of the sifted out questions the process is completed by summative assessment using a new set of questions that only cover the topics previously taught electronic performance support system an electronic performance support system epss is according to barry raybould a computer-based system that improves worker productivity by providing on-the-job access to integrated information advice and learning experiences gloria gery defines it as an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate individualized on-line access to the full range of information software guidance advice and assistance data images tools and assessment and monitoring systems to permit job performance with minimal support and intervention by others learning objects main article learning object content content and design architecture issues include pedagogy and learning object re-use one approach looks at five aspects fact - unique data eg symbols for excel formula or the parts that make up a learning objective concept - a category that includes multiple examples eg excel formulas or the various typestheories of instructional design process - a flow of events or activities eg how a spreadsheet works or the five phases in addie procedure - step-by-step task eg entering a formula into a spreadsheet or the steps that should be followed within a phase in addie strategic principle - task performed by adapting guidelines eg doing a financial projection in a spreadsheet or using a framework for designing learning environments pedagogical elements pedagogical elements are defined as structures or units of educational material they are the educational content that is to be delivered these units are independent of format meaning that although the unit may be delivered in various ways the pedagogical structures themselves are not the textbook web page video conference podcast lesson assignment multiple choice question quiz discussion group or a case study all of which are possible methods of delivery learning objects standards much effort has been put into the technical reuse of electronically based teaching materials and in particular creating or re-using learning objects these are self-contained units that are properly tagged with keywords or other metadata and often stored in an xml file format creating a course requires putting together a sequence of learning objects there are both proprietary and open non-commercial and commercial peer-reviewed repositories of learning objects such as the merlot repository sharable content object reference model scorm is a collection of standards and specifications that applies to certain web-based e-learning other specifications such as schools framework allow for the transporting of learning objects or for categorizing metadata lom settings preschool various forms of electronic media are a feature of preschool life although parents report a positive experience the impact of such use has not been systematically assessed the age when a given child might start using a particular technology such as a cellphone or computer might depend on matching a technological resource to the recipients developmental capabilities such as the age-anticipated stages labeled by swiss psychologist jean piaget parameters such as age-appropriateness coherence with sought-after values and concurrent entertainment and educational aspects have been suggested for choosing media k-12 e-learning is utilized by public k-12 schools in the united states as well as private schools some e-learning environments take place in a traditional classroom others allow students to attend classes from home or other locations there are several states that are utilizing virtual school platforms for e-learning across the country that continue to increase virtual school enables students to log into synchronous learning or asynchronous learning courses anywhere there is an internet connection e-learning is increasingly being utilized by students who may not want to go to traditional brick and mortar schools due to severe allergies or other medical issues fear of school violence and school bullying and students whose parents would like to homeschool but do not feel qualified online schools create a haven for students to receive a quality education while almost completely avoiding these common problems online charter schools also often are not limited by location income level or class size in the way brick and mortar charter schools are e-learning also has been rising as a supplement to the traditional classroom students with special talents or interests outside of the available curricula use e-learning to advance their skills or exceed grade restrictions some online institutions connect students with instructors via web conference technology to form a digital classroom national private schools are also available online these provide the benefits of e-learning to students in states where charter online schools are not available they also may allow students greater flexibility and exemption from state testing virtual education in k-12 schooling often refers to virtual schools and in higher education to virtual universities virtual schools are cybercharter schools with innovative administrative models and course delivery technology higher education online college course enrollment has seen a 29% increase in enrollment with nearly one third of all college students or an estimated 6.7 million students are currently enrolled in online classes in 2009 44 percent of post-secondary students in the usa were taking some or all of their courses online which was projected to rise to 81 percent by 2014 although a large proportion of for-profit higher education institutions now offer online classes only about half of private non-profit schools do so private institutions may become more involved with on-line presentations as the costs decrease properly trained staff must also be hired to work with students online these staff members need to understand the content area and also be highly trained in the use of the computer and internet online education is rapidly increasing and online doctoral programs have even developed at leading research universities although massive open online courses moocs may have limitations that preclude them from fully replacing college education such programs have significantly expanded mit stanford and princeton university offer classes to a global audience but not for college credit university-level programs like edx founded by massachusetts institute of technology and harvard university offer wide range of disciplines at no charge while others permit students to audit a course at no charge but require a small fee for accreditation moocs have not had a significant impact on higher education and declined after the initial expansion but are expected to remain in some form private organizations also offer classes such as udacity with free computer science classes and khan academy with over 3,900 free micro-lectures available via youtube distributed open collaborative course docc sees itself as a counter-movement to mooc emphasizing decentralized teaching university of the people is a non-profit accredited online university coursera offers online courses according to fortune magazine over a million people worldwide have enrolled in free online courses corporate and professional companies with large and spread out distribution chains use e-learning to educate sales staff and customers about the latest product developments continuing professional development cpd can deliver regulatory compliance updates and staff development of valuable workplace skills corporations and organizations are nowwhen integrating learning platforms within their organization at an increasing rate new micro-learning tactics can provide companies with an interface that encourages employee development public health there is an important need for recent reliable and high-quality health information to be made available to the public as well as in summarized form for public health providers providers have indicated the need for automatic notification of the latest research a single searchable portal of information and access to grey literature the maternal and child health mch library is funded by the us maternal and child health bureau to screen the latest research and develop automatic notifications to providers through the mch alert another application in public health is the development of mhealth use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia into global public health mhealth has been used to promote prenatal and newborn services with positive outcomes in addition health systems have implemented mhealth programs to facilitate emergency medical responses point-of-care support health promotion and data collection in low and middle income countries mhealth is most frequently used as one-way text messages or phone reminders to promote treatment adherence and gather data adhd there has also been a growing interest in e-learning as a beneficial educational method for students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd with the growing popularity in e-learning among k-12 and higher education the opportunity to take online classes is becoming increasingly important for students of all ages however students with adhd and special needs face different learning demands compared to the typical developing learner this is especially significant considering the dramatic rise in adhd diagnoses in the last decade among both children and adults compared to the traditional face-to-face classroom e-learning and virtual classrooms require a higher level of executive functions which is the primary deficit associated with adhd although adhd is not specifically named in the rehabilitation act of 1973 students with adhd who have symptoms that interfere with their learning or ability may be eligible for assistive technology some examples of the resources that may help interest students and adults with adhd consist of computer software brain games timers calendars voice recognition devices screen magnifiers and talking books wolf lists 12 executive function skills necessary for students to succeed in postsecondary education plan set goals organize initiate sustain attentioneffort flexibility monitor use feedback structure manage time manage materials and follow through these skills along with strong independent and self-regulated learning are especially pronounced in the online environment and as many adhd students suffer from a deficit in one or more of these executive functions this presents a significant challenge and accessibility barrier to the current e-learning approach some have noted that current e-learning models are moving towards applying a constructivism learning theory that emphasizes a learner-centered environment and postulates that everyone has the ability to construct their own knowledge and meaning through a process of problem solving and discovery however some principles of constructivism may not be appropriate for adhd learners these principles include active learning self-monitoring motivation and strong focus despite the limitations students with special needs including adhd have expressed an overall enthusiasm for e-learning and have identified a number e-learning benefits including availability of online course notes materials and additional resources the ability to work at an independent pace and spend extra time spent formulating thoughtful responses in class discussions help in understanding course lecturecontent ability to review lectures multiple times and enhanced access to and communication with the course instructor disabilities the design of e-learning platforms in ways that enable universal access has received attention from several directions including the world wide web consortiums web accessibility initiative wai wai provides universal formatting standards for websites so they can remain accessible to people with disabilities for example developing or adopting e-learning material can enable accessibility for people with visual impairment the perkins school for the blind offers learning resources tailored for the visually impaired including webcasts webinars downloadable science activities and an online library that has access to over 40,000 resource materials on blindness and deaf blindness online education may appear to be a promising alternative for students with physical and sensory disabilities because they get to work at their own pace and in their own home however not all online programs are equal when it comes to their resources for students with disabilities students with disabilities who wish to enroll in online education must either be able to advocate for themselves and their own rights or have a person whom is willing to advocate for them the american with disabilities act states that online programs must provide appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities but has not specifically defined what that means once students with disabilities are accepted into an online program they should prepare to be direct and open about what they need to succeed experts say haynie identity options educational technology particularly in online learning environments can allow students to use real identity pseudonym or anonymous identity during classroom communication advantages in anonymizing race age and gender are increased student participation and increased cross-cultural communication risks include increased cyberbullying and aggressive or hostile language benefits effective technology use deploys multiple evidence-based strategies concurrently eg adaptive content frequent testing immediate feedback etc as do effective teachers using computers or other forms of technology can give students practice on core content and skills while the teacher can work with others conduct assessments or perform other tasks through the use of educational technology education is able to be individualized for each student allowing for better differentiation and allowing students to work for mastery at their own pace modern educational technology can improve access to education including full degree programs it enables better integration for non-full-time students particularly in continuing education and improved interactions between students and instructors learning material can be used for long distance learning and are accessible to a wider audience course materials are easy to access in 2010 70.3% of american family households had access to the internet in 2013 according to canadian radio television and telecommunications commission canada 79% of homes have access to the internet students can access and engage with numerous online resources at home using online resources such as khan academy or ted talks can help students spend more time on specific aspects of what they may be learning in school but at home schools like mit have made certain course materials free online although some aspects of a classroom setting are missed by using these resources they are helpful tools to add additional support to the educational system the necessity to pay for transport to the educational facility is removed students appreciate the convenience of e-learning but report greater engagement in face-to-face learning environments according to james kulik who studies the effectiveness of computers used for instruction students usually learn more in less time when receiving computer-based instruction and they like classes more and develop more positive attitudes toward computers in computer-based classes students can independently solve problems there are no intrinsic age-based restrictions on difficulty level ie students can go at their own pace students editing their written work on word processors improve the quality of their writing according to some studies the students are better at critiquing and editing written work that is exchanged over a computer network with students they know studies completed in computer intensive settings found increases in student-centric cooperative and higher order learning writing skills problem solving and using technology in addition attitudes toward technology as a learning tool by parents students and teachers are also improved employers acceptance of online education has risen over time more than 50% of human resource managers shrm surveyed for an august 2010 report said that if two candidates with the same level of experience were applying for a job it would not have any kind of effect whether the candidates obtained degree was acquired through an online or a traditional school seventy-nine percent said they had employed a candidate with an online degree in the past 12 months however 66% said candidates who get degrees online were not seen as positively as a job applicant with traditional degrees the use of educational apps generally has positive effect on learning pre- and post- tests reveal that the use of apps on mobile devices reduces the achievement gap between struggling and average students some educational apps improve group work by allowing students to receive feedback on answers and promoting collaboration in solving problems examples of these apps can be found in the third paragraph the benefits of app-assisted learning have been exhibited in all age groups kindergarten students that use ipads show much higher rates of literacy than non-users medical students at university of california irvine that utilized ipad academically have been reported to score 23% higher on national exams than previous classes that did not mobile devices and apps have also been shown to assist in the education of disabled students with one study reporting increased engagement and accelerated comprehension and learning disadvantages many us states spend large sums of money on technology however as of 2013 none were looking at technology return on investment roi to connect expenditures on technology with improved student outcomes new technologies are frequently accompanied by unrealistic hype and promise regarding their transformative power to change education for the better or in allowing better educational opportunities to reach the masses examples include silent film broadcast radio and television none of which have maintained much of a foothold in the daily practices of mainstream formal education technology in and of itself does not necessarily result in fundamental improvements to educational practice the focus needs to be on the learners interaction with technologynot the technology itself it needs to be recognized as ecological rather than additive or subtractive in this ecological change one significant change will create total change according to branford et al technology does not guarantee effective learning and inappropriate use of technology can even hinder it a university of washington study of infant vocabulary shows that it is slipping due to educational baby dvds published in the journal of pediatrics a 2007 university of washington study on the vocabulary of babies surveyed over 1,000 parents in washington and minnesota the study found that for every one hour that babies 8-16 months of age watched dvds and videos they knew 6-8 fewer of 90 common baby words than the babies that did not watch them andrew meltzoff a surveyor in this study states that the result makes sense that if the babys alert time is spent in front of dvds and tv instead of with people speaking the babies are not going to get the same linguistic experience dr dimitri chistakis another surveyor reported that the evidence is mounting that baby dvds are of no value and may be harmful adaptive instructional materials tailor questions to each students ability and calculate their scores but this encourages students to work individually rather than socially or collaboratively kruse 2013 social relationships are important but high-tech environments may compromise the balance of trust care and respect between teacher and student massively open online courses moocs although quite popular in discussions of technology and education in developed countries more so in us are not a major concern in most developing or low-income countries one of the stated goals of moocs is to provide less fortunate populations ie in developing countries an opportunity to experience courses with us-style content and structure however research shows only 3% of the registrants are from low-income countries and although many courses have thousands of registered students only 5-10% of them complete the course moocs also implies that certain curriculum and teaching methods are superior and this could eventually wash over or possibly washing out local educational institutions cultural norms and educational traditions with the internet and social media using educational apps makes the students highly susceptible to distraction and sidetracking even though proper use has shown to increase student performances being distracted would be detrimental another disadvantage is increased potential for cheating smartphones can be very easy to hide and use inconspicuously especially if their use is normalized in the classroom these disadvantages can be managed with strict rules and regulations on mobile phone use over-stimulation electronic devices such as cellphones and computers facilitate rapid access to a stream of sources each of which may receive cursory attention michel rich an associate professor at harvard medical school and executive director of the center on media and child health in boston said of the digital generation their brains are rewarded not for staying on task but for jumping to the next thing the worry is were raising a generation of kids in front of screens whose brains are going to be wired differently students have always faced distractions computers and cellphones are a particular challenge because the stream of data can interfere with focusing and learning although these technologies affect adults too young people may be more influenced by it as their developing brains can easily become habituated to switching tasks and become unaccustomed to sustaining attention too much information coming too rapidly can overwhelm thinking technology is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains high exposure levels stimulate brain cell alteration and release neurotransmitters which causes the strengthening of some neural pathways and weakening of others this leads to heightened stress levels on the brain that at first boost energy levels but over time actually augment memoryimpair cognition lead to depression alter the neural circuity of the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex these are the brain regions that control mood and thought if unchecked the underlying structure of the brain could be altered over-stimulation due to technology may begin too young when children are exposed before the age of seven important developmental tasks may be delayed and bad learning habits might develop which deprives children of the exploration and play that they need to develop sociocultural criticism according to lai the learning environment is a complex system where the interplay and interactions of many things impact the outcome of learning when technology is brought into an educational setting the pedagogical setting changes in that technology-driven teaching can change the entire meaning of an activity without adequate research validation if technology monopolizes an activity students can begin to develop the sense that life would scarcely be thinkable without technology leo marx considered the word technology itself as problematic susceptible to reification and phantom objectivity which conceals its fundamental nature as something that is only valuable insofar as it benefits the human condition technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil langdon winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the making versus the uses of new technologies and that a narrow focus on use leads us to believe that all technologies are neutral in moral standing these critiques would have us ask not how do we maximize the role or advancement of technology in education but rather what are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology winner viewed technology as a form of life that not only aids human activity but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning for example the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity but they also radically change the process of production itself thereby redefining what is meant by work in such a setting in education standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and assessment we rarely explicitly reflect on how strange a notion it is that a number between say 0 and 100 could accurately reflect a persons knowledge about the world according to winner the recurring patterns in everyday life tend to become an unconscious process that we learn to take for granted winner writes by far the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument system or technique is introduced because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment economic investment and social habit the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made in that sense technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations p 29 when adopting new technologies there may be one best chance to get it right seymour papert p 32 points out a good example of a bad choice that has become strongly fixed in social habit and material equipment our choice to use the qwerty keyboard the qwerty arrangement of letters on the keyboard was originally chosen not because it was the most efficient for typing but because early typewriters were prone to jam when adjacent keys were struck in quick succession now that typing has become a digital process this is no longer an issue but the qwerty arrangement lives on as a social habit one that is very difficult to change neil postman endorsed the notion that technology impacts human cultures including the culture of classrooms and that this is a consideration even more important than considering the efficiency of a new technology as a tool for teaching regarding the computers impact on education postman writes p 19 what we need to consider about the computer has nothing to do with its efficiency as a teaching tool we need to know in what ways it is altering our conception of learning and how in conjunction with television it undermines the old idea of school digital divide main article digital divide the concept of the digital divide is a gap between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not access may be associated with age gender socio-economic status education income ethnicity and geography teacher training teacher training ensures effective integration of classroom technology the current school curriculum tends to guide teachers in training students to be autonomous problem solvers this has become a significant barrier to effective training because the traditional methods of teaching have clashed with what is now expected in the present workplace todays students in the workplace are increasingly being asked to work in teams drawing on different sets of expertise and collaborating to solve problem these experiences are not highly centered on in the traditional classroom but are twenty-first century skills that can be attained through the incorporation and engagement with technology changes in instruction and use of technology can also promote a higher level of learning among students with different types of intelligence technology is not the end goal of education but rather a means by which it can be accomplished educators must have a good grasp of the technology being used and its advantages over more traditional methods if there is a lack in either of these areas technology be a hindrance rather than benefit to teaching the evolving nature of technology may unsettle teachers who may experience themselves as perpetual novices the ways in which teachers are taught to use technology is also outdated because the primary focus of training is on computer literacy rather than the deeper more essential understanding and mastery of technology for information processing communication and problem solving new resources have to be designed and distributed whenever the technological platform has been changed however finding quality materials to support classroom objectives after such changes is often difficult random professional development days are inadequate teachers may not feel the need to change the traditional education system because it has been successful in the past this does not necessarily mean it is the right way to teach for the current and future generations however learning styles and the methods of collecting information have evolved and students often feel locked out of the worlds described in their textbooks through the depersonalized and abstract prose used to describe them assessment there are two distinct issues of assessment the assessment of educational technology and assessment with technology expenditure the five key sectors of the e-learning industry are consulting content technologies services and support worldwide e-learning was estimated in 2000 to be over $48 billion according to conservative estimates commercial growth has been brisk in 2014 the worldwide commercial market activity was estimated at $6 billion venture capital over the past five years with self-paced learning generating $35.6 billion in 2011 north american e-learning generated $23.3 billion in revenue in 2013 with a 9% growth rate in cloud based authoring tools and learning platforms careers main articles educational technologist and educational psychologist educational technologists and psychologists apply basic educational and psychological research into an evidence-based applied science or a technology of learning or instruction in

psychology or more purely in the fields of educational instructional or human performance technology or instructional design in industry educational technology is utilized to train students and employees by a wide range of learning and communication practitioners including instructional designers technical trainers technical communication and professional communication specialists technical writers and of course primary school and college teachers of all levels the transformation of educational technology from a cottage industry to a profession is discussed by shurville et al
