chlorodifluoromethane chlorodifluoromethane or difluoromonochloromethane is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon hcfc this colorless gas is better known as hcfc-22 or r-22 it is commonly used as a propellant and refrigerant these applications are being phased out in developed countries due to the compounds ozone depletion potential odp and high global warming potential gwp although global use of r-22 continues to increase because of high demand in developing countries r-22 is a versatile intermediate in industrial organofluorine chemistry eg as a precursor to tetrafluoroethylene r-22 cylinders are colored light green production and current applications worldwide production of r-22 in 2008 was about 800 gg per year up from about 450 gg per year in 1998 with most production in developing countries r-22 use is increasing in developing countries largely for air conditioning applications air conditioning sales are growing 20% annually in india and china r-22 is prepared from chloroform hccl 3 + 2 hf → hcf 2cl + 2 hcl an important application of r-22 is as a precursor to tetrafluoroethylene this conversion involves pyrolysis to give difluorocarbene which dimerizes 2 chclf 2 → c 2f 4 + 2 hcl the compound also yields difluorocarbene upon treatment with strong base and is used in the laboratory as a source of this reactive intermediate the pyrolysis of r-22 in the presence of chlorofluoromethane gives hexafluorobenzene environmental effects r-22 is often used as an alternative to the highly ozone-depleting cfc-11 and cfc-12 because of its relatively low ozone depletion potential of 0.055 among the lowest for chlorine-containing haloalkanes however even this lower ozone depletion potential is no longer considered acceptable as an additional environmental concern r-22 is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 1810 which indicates 1810 times as powerful as carbon dioxide4 hydrofluorocarbons hfcs are often substituted for r-22 because of their lower ozone depleting potential but these refrigerants also have high global warming potential r-410a for example is often substituted but has a global warming potential of 1725 another substitute is r404a with a global warming potential of 3900 other substitute refrigerants are available with low global warming potential ammonia r717 for example has a global warming potential of <1 and is a popular substitute on fishing vessels propane r-290 is another example and has a global warming potential of 3 although it is rarely used in refrigeration systems because of its flammability and potential for explosion phaseout in the european union since january 1 2010 it has been illegal to use newly manufactured hcfcs to service refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment - only reclaimed and recycled hcfcs may be used in practice this means that the gas has to be removed from the equipment before servicing and replaced afterwards rather than refilling with new gas since january 1 2015 it has been illegal to use any hcfcs to service refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment broken equipment that used hcfc refrigerants must be replaced with equipment that does not use them phaseout in the united states r-22 has been mostly phased out in new equipment in the united states under the montreal protocol and has been replaced by other refrigerants with lower ozone depletion potential such as propane r-290 pentafluoroethane r-134a 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and blended mixtures of hfcs such as r-409a r-410a r-438a and r-507a see refrigerant for specific components of the r-400 and r-500 hfc blends used to replace r-22 beginning january 1 2004 the montreal protocol required the us to reduce its consumption of hcfcs by 35% below the us baseline cap as of january 1 2003 the united states environmental protection agency banned production and import of hcfc-141b the most ozone-destructive hcfc this action allowed the united states to meet its obligations under the montreal protocol epa was able to issue 100% of company baseline allowances for production and import of hcfc-22 and hcfc-142b beginning january 1 2010 the montreal protocol required the us to reduce its consumption of hcfcs by 75% below the us baseline allowance holders may only produce or import hcfc-22 to service existing equipment virgin r-22 may not be used in new equipment as a result heating ventilation and air-conditioning hvac system manufacturers may not produce new air conditioners and heat pumps containing r-22 beginning january 1 2015 the montreal protocol requires the us to reduce its consumption of hcfcs by 90% below the us baseline beginning january 1 2020 the montreal protocol requires the us to reduce its consumption of hcfcs by 99.5% below the us baseline refrigerant that has been recovered and recycledreclaimed will be allowed beyond 2020 to service existing systems but chemical manufacturers will no longer be able to produce r-22 to service existing air conditioners and heat pumps r-22 retrofit using substitute refrigerants r-407a is for use in for low- and medium-temp refrigeration uses a poe oil r-407z is for use in air conditioning uses a minimum of 20 percent poe oil r-407f is for use in medium- and low-temperature refrigeration applications supermarkets cold storage and process refrigeration direct expansion system design only uses a poe oil r-421a is for use in air conditioning split systems heat pumps supermarket pak systems dairy chillers reach-in storage bakery applications refrigerated transport self-contained display cabinets and walk-in coolers uses mo to poe r-422b is for use in low- medium- and high-temperature applications it is not recommended for use in flooded applications r-422c is for use in medium- and low-temperature applications the txv power element will need to be changed to a 404a507a element and critical seals elastomers may need to be replaced r-422d is for use in low-temp applications and is mineral oil compatible r-424a is for use in air conditioning as well as medium-temp refrigeration temperature ranges of 20 to 50˚f it works with mo ab and poe oils r-427a is for use in air conditioning and refrigeration applications it does not require all the mineral oil to be removed it works with mo ab and poe oils r-434a is for use in water cooled and process chillers for air conditioning and medium- and low-temperature applications it works with mo ab and poe oils r-438a is for use in low- medium- and high-temperature applications it is compatible with all lubricants physical properties it has two allotropes crystalline ii below 59 k and crystalline i above 59 k to 115.73 k price history and availability epas analysis indicated the amount of existing inventory was between 22,700 mt metric tons and 45,400 mt tbd = to be determined in 2012 the epa reduced the amount of r-22 by 45% causing the price to rise by more than 300% for 2013 the epa has reduced the amount of r-22 by 29%
