ton not to be confused with tonnage or tonne for other uses see ton disambiguation the ton is a unit of measure it has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years it is used principally as a unit of mass its original use as a measurement of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in terms such as the freight ton it can also be used as a measure of energy for truck classification or as a colloquial term it is derived from the tun the term applied to a barrel of the largest size this could contain a volume between 175 and 213 imperial gallons 210 and 256 us gal which could weigh around 2,000 pounds 910 kg and occupy some 60 cubic feet 1.7 m3 of space in the united kingdom the ton is defined as 2,240 pounds 1,016 kg avoirdupois pounds from 1965 the uk embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units including the tonne metric ton defined as 1000 kg 2,204.6 lbs the uk weights and measures act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms including the ton and the term metric ton for tonne in the united states and formerly canada a ton is defined to be 2,000 pounds 907 kg where confusion is possible the 2240 lb ton is called long ton and the 2000 lb ton short ton the tonne is distinguished by its spelling but usually pronounced the same as ton hence the us term metric ton in the uk the final e of tonne can also be pronounced ˈtʌnɪ or metric ton when it is necessary to make the distinction where accuracy is required the correct term must be used but for many purposes this is not necessary the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6% and the short ton is within 11% of both the ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech the term ton is also used to refer to a number of units of volume ranging from 35 to 100 cubic feet 0.99 to 2.83 m3 in capacity it can also be used as a unit of energy expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt or tnt detonated in refrigeration a ton is a unit of power sometimes called a ton of refrigeration it is the power required to melt or freeze one short ton of ice per day the refrigeration tonhour is a unit of energy the energy required to melt or freeze 1⁄24 short ton of ice units of massweight there are several similar units of mass or volume called the ton ^ a b in the uk ton 2240 lb and tonne are usually pronounced the same tʌn as they only differ by 2% ambiguity is not necessarily a problem where accuracy is required in speech long ton or exaggerated pronunciation of tonne emphasising the e ˈtʌnɪ are used ^ a b the longweight and shortweight tons were used as a means of making an allowance for wastage in an industrial process the workman is provided with a longweight ton and is expected to return a shortweight ton of processed product these measures were particularly used in the operation of hammering iron blooms into shape ^ in other industries a different longweight ton might be used coal miners delivered coal to the surface in longweight tons but were paid only for a shortweight ton this was supposedly to allow for dirt non-coal rocks in the output mine owners however were free to set the value of the longweight ton at a value of their own choosing and in at least some cases it was set to 25 cwt 2800 lb compared to the 20 cwt shortweight ton this was a source of discontent amongst the miners who saw the practice as unfair in favour of the mine owners others the long ton is used for petroleum products such as aviation fuel deadweight ton abbreviation dwt or dwt is a measure of a ships carrying capacity including bunker oil fresh water ballast water crew and provisions it is expressed in tonnes 1000 kg or long tons 2240 pounds about 1016 kg this measurement is also used in the us tonnage of naval ships increasingly tonnes are being used rather than long tons in measuring the displacement of ships see tonnage harbour ton used in south africa in the 20th century 2000 pounds or one short ton both the long ton and the short ton are 20 hundredweight being 112 and 100 pounds respectively before the twentieth century there were several definitions prior to the 15th century in england the ton was 20 hundredweight each of 108 lb giving a ton of 2,160 pounds 980 kgcitation needed in the nineteenth century in different parts of britain definitions of 2240 2352 and 2400 lb were used with 2000 lb for explosives the legal ton was usually sic 2240 lb assay ton abbreviation at is not a unit of measurement but a standard quantity used in assaying ores of precious metals it is 29 1⁄6 grams short assay ton or 32 2⁄3 grams long assay ton the amount which bears the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bears to a troy ounce in other words the number of milligrams of a particular metal found in a sample of this size gives the number of troy ounces contained in a short or long ton of ore in documents that predate 1960 the word ton is sometimes spelled tonne but in more recent documents tonne refers exclusively to the metric ton in nuclear power plants thm and mthm mean tonnes of heavy metals and mtu means tonnes of uranium in the steel industry the abbreviation thm means tonstonnes hot metal which refers to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced particularly in the context of blast furnace production or specific consumption a dry ton or dry tonne has the same mass value but the material sludge slurries compost and similar mixtures in which solid material is soaked with or suspended in water has been dried to a relatively low consistent moisture level dry weight if the material is in its natural wet state it is called a wet ton or wet tonne units of volume see also tonnage the displacement essentially the weight of a ship is traditionally expressed in long tons to simplify measurement it is determined by measuring the volume rather than weight of water displaced and calculating the weight from the volume and density for practical purposes the displacement ton dt is a unit of volume 35 cubic feet 0.9911 m3 the approximate volume occupied by one ton of seawater the actual volume varies with salinity and temperature it is slightly less than the 224 imperial gallons 1.018 m3 of the water ton based on distilled water one measurement ton or freight ton is equal to 40 cubic feet 1.133 m3 but historically it has had several different definitions it is sometimes abbreviated as mton the freight ton represents the volume of a truck train or other freight carrier in the past it has been used for a cargo ship but the register ton is now preferred it is correctly abbreviated as ftcitation needed but some users are now using freight ton to represent a weight of 1 tonne 1,000 kg 2,205 lb thus the more common abbreviations are now mt mt or mton for measurement ton which still cause it to be confused with the tonne or even the megatonne the register ton is a unit of volume used for the cargo capacity of a ship defined as 100 cubic feet 2.832 m3 it is often abbreviated rt or grt for gross registered ton the former providing confusion with the refrigeration ton it is known as a tonneau de mer in belgium but in france a tonneau de mer is 1.44 cubic metres 50.85 cu ft the panama canaluniversal measurement system pcums is based on net tonnage modified for panama canal billing purposes pcums is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessels total volume a pcums net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity the water ton is used chiefly in great britain in statistics dealing with petroleum products and is defined as 224 imperial gallons 35.96 cu ft 1.018 m3 the volume occupied by 1 long ton 2,240 lb 1,016 kg of water under the conditions that define the imperial gallon units

calorie cal is equal to one kilocalorie kcal and is gradually being replaced by the latter correct term early values for the explosive energy released by trinitrotoluene tnt ranged from 900 to 1100 calories per gram in order to standardise the use of the term tnt as a unit of energy an arbitrary value was assigned based on 1000 calories 1 kcal or 4.184 kj per gram thus there is no longer a direct connection to the chemical tnt itself it is now merely a unit of energy that happens to be expressed using words normally associated with mass eg kilogram tonne pound the definition applies for both spellings ton of tnt and tonne of tnt measurements in tons of tnt have been used primarily to express nuclear weapon yields though they have also been used since in seismology as well tonne of

used in refrigeration and air conditioning to measure the rate of heat absorption prior to the introduction of mechanical refrigeration cooling was accomplished by delivering ice installing one ton of mechanical refrigeration capacity replaced the daily delivery of one ton of ice in north america a standard ton of refrigeration is 12,000 btuh 3,517 w the heat absorption per day is approximately the heat of fusion of 1 ton of ice at 32 °f 0 °c this is approximately the power required to melt one short ton 2,000 lb or 907 kg of ice at 0 °c 32 °f in 24 hours thus representing the delivery of 1 short ton 0.893 long tons 0.907 t of ice per day a less common usage is the power required to cool 1 long ton 2,240 lb or 1,016 kg = 1 long ton or 1.120 short tons or 1.016 t of water by 1 °f 0.56 °c every 10 minutes = 13,440 btuh 3,939 w a refrigeration ton should be regarded as power produced by a chiller when operating in standard ahri conditions which are typically 44 °f 7 °c for chilled water unit and 95 °f 35 °c air entering the condenser this is commonly referred to as true ton manufacturers can also provide tables for chillers operating at other chilled water temperature conditions as 65 °f or 18.3 °c which can show more favorable data which are not valid when making performance comparisons among units unless conversion rates are appliedcitation needed the refrigeration ton is commonly abbreviated as rt informal tons ton is also used informally often as slang to mean a large amount of something material or not for example i have a ton of homework to do this weekend in britain a ton is colloquially used to refer to 100 of a given unit ton can thus refer to a speed of 100 miles per hour and is prefixed by an indefinite article eg lee was doing a ton down the motorway to money eg how much did you pay for that a ton £100 to 100 points in a game eg eric just threw a ton in our darts game in some games eg cricket more commonly called a century or to a hundred of any other countable figure in dutch when talking about money a ton is used to indicate 100,000 for example a house costing 2 ton would cost 200,000 euros this convention has been in use since at least the 18th century in finnish tonni is often used as a synonym for one thousand 1000 especially when referring to money for example tonnin seteli was a 1000 marks banknote and a popular tv show was called
