gansu wind farm the gansu wind farm project also called jiuquan wind power base is a group of large wind farms under construction in western gansu province in china 40°12n 96°54e﻿ ﻿40.2°n 96.9°e﻿ 40.2 96.9 40°36n 96°54e﻿ ﻿40.6°n 96.9°e﻿ 40.6 96.9 40°14n 97°08e﻿ ﻿40.23°n 97.13°e﻿ 40.23 97.13 the gansu wind farm project is located in desert areas near the city of jiuquan in two localities of guazhou county and also near yumen city in the northwest province of gansu which has an abundance of wind resources the 8 gw of initial planned capacity of this wind farm is similar to that of the kashiwazaki-kariwa nuclear power plant in japan which was the largest nuclear power plant in the world until its closure in 2012 however a capacity factor of about 25% must be included for wind and even at the final 20 gw capacity this wind farm will generate less than kashiwazaki-kariwa at its peak when fully completed the entire project may become the worlds biggest collective windfarm overview the project is one of six national wind power megaprojects approved by the chinese government it is expected to grow to 20,000 megawatts by 2020 at an estimated cost of 120 billion chinese yuan $17.5 billion the project is being built by more than 20 developers in two localities in guazhou county and also near yumen city construction phases the project is divided to multiple phases the first 3,800 mw phase consists of eighteen 200 mw wind farms and two 100 mw wind farms the second 8,000 mw phase will consist of forty 200 mw wind farms the planned capacity is 5,160 mw by 2010 12,710 mw by 2015 and 20,000 mw in 2020 in 2008 construction began on a 750 kv ac power line to carry electricity from the wind farm and construction of the wind farms themselves started in august 2009 power is being purchased for 0.54 yuan per kwh even though electricity from coal fired powerplants would be about half that price since operations began some 6.26 billion kwh has been generated as of october 31 2011 with 5.96 billion kwh of that produced in 2011 as of november 2010 the projects installed capacity was 5,160 mw which rose to approximately 6,000 mw in march 2012roughly equivalent to the united kingdoms entire wind power capacity at that timewith new wind turbines being erected at the rate of 36 per day first phase completion in november 2010 officials announced the completion of the projects first phase involving the installation of over 3,500 wind turbines with an installed capacity of approximately 5,160 mw according to wang jianxin director of the jiuquan development and reform commission at that time the projects wind parks were generating 1,150 mw coordinated control centre on march 1 2012 a wind power coordinated control system was implemented to adjust the output of the 18 wind farms of the gansu wind farm project which total 10 million kw to meet the needs of the transmission grid which is limited to 1.5 million kw this permitted the production of 1 million kwh more per day than previously and greatly improves the systems stability curtailment of wind turbine operations is a first order method for dealing with the intermittency of wind but normally loses available output when the power grids transmission capacity has been reached other methods involve either added local industrial usage or added local storage capacity
