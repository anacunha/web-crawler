fire protection engineering fire engineering redirects here for the magazine see fire engineering magazine fire engineering is the application of science and engineering principles to protect people property and their environments from the harmful and destructive effects of fire and smoke it encompasses fire protection engineering which focuses on fire detection suppression and mitigation and fire safety engineering which focuses on human behavior and maintaining a tenable environment for evacuation from a fire in the united states fire protection engineering is often used to include fire safety engineering the discipline of fire engineering includes but is not exclusive to fire detection - fire alarm systems and brigade call systems active fire protection - fire suppression systems passive fire protection - fire and smoke barriers space separation smoke control and management escape facilities- emergency exits fire lifts etc building design layout and space planning fire prevention programs fire dynamics and fire modeling human behavior during fire events risk analysis including economic factors wildfire management 1 fire protection engineers identify risks and design safeguards that aid in preventing controlling and mitigating the effects of fires fire engineers assist architects building owners and developers in evaluating buildings life safety and property protection goals fire engineers are also employed as fire investigators including such very large-scale cases as the analysis of the collapse of the world trade centers nasa uses fire engineers in its space program to help improve safety fire engineers are also employed to provide 3rd party review for performance based fire engineering solutions submitted in support of local building regulation applications currently mr jwala sharma a fire safety professional from india stated that fire behaviour is directly related to the whether and climatic conditions mr jwala sharma also stated that if we burn fire on earth the safety aspects are normal but if we burn fire in space outside the earth then the aspects of safety are changed mr jwala sharma currently holds the bachelors degree in industrial and fire safety from ies ips college india and he holds also the position of chairman in asian society of safety engineers currently he resides in gujarat jamnagar with his wife and one son mr jwala sharma stated that both india and pakistan in india needs more improvements in fire engineering according to him indian govt pakistan governments need to improve the status of fire professionals history fire engineerings roots date back to ancient rome when the emperor nero ordered the city to be rebuilt utilizing passive fire protection methods such as space separation and non-combustible building materials after a catastrophic fire the discipline of fire engineering emerged in the early 20th century as a distinct discipline separate from civil mechanical and chemical engineering in response to new fire problems posed by the industrial revolution fire protection engineers of this era concerned themselves with devising methods to protect large factories particularly spinning mills and other manufacturing propertiescitation needed another motivation to organize the discipline define practices and conduct research to support innovations was in response to the catastrophic conflagrations and mass urban fires that swept many major cities during the latter half of the 19th century see city or area fires the insurance industry also helped promote advancements in the fire engineering profession and the development of fire protection systems and equipment in 1903 the first degree program in fire protection engineering was initiated as the armour institute of technology later becoming part of the illinois institute of technology as the 20th century emerged several catastrophic firescitation neededresulted in changes to buildings codes to better protect people and property from fire it was only in the latter half of the 20th century that fire protection engineering emerged as a unique engineering professioncitation needed the primary reason for this emergence was the development of the body of knowledge specific to the profession that occurred after 1950citation needed other factors contributing to the growth of the profession include the start of the institution of fire engineers in 1918 in the uk and the society of fire protection engineers in 1950 in the usa the emergence of independent fire protection consulting engineer and the promulgation of engineering standards for fire protectioncitation needed education fire engineers like their counterparts in other engineering and scientific disciplines undertake a formal course of education and continuing professional development to acquire and maintain their competence this education typically includes foundation studies in mathematics physics chemistry and technical writing professional engineering studies focus students on acquiring proficiency in material science statics dynamics thermodynamics fluid dynamics heat transfer engineering economics ethics systems in engineering reliability and environmental psychology studies in combustion probabilistic risk assessment or risk management the design of fire suppression systems the application and interpretation of model building codes and the measurement and simulation of fire phenomena complete most curricula new zealand was one of the first countries in the world to introduce performance based assessment methods into their building codes in regard to fire safety this occurred with the introduction of their 1991 building act professor andy buchanan of the university of canterbury established the first post graduate and only course available in new zealand at the time in fire safety engineering in 1995 applicants to the course require a minimum qualification of a bachelors degree in engineering or bachelors degree in a limited list of science course notable alumni from the university of canterbury include but is not limited to sir ernest rutherford robert bob park roy kerr michael p collins john britten and many others a masters degree in fire engineering from the university of canterbury is recognized under the washington accord in the united states the university of maryland umd offers the only abet-accredited bs degree program in fire protection engineering as well as graduate degrees and a distance meng program worcester polytechnic institute wpi offers an ms and a phd in fire protection engineering as well as online graduate programs in this discipline ms and a graduate certificate as of 2011update cal poly offers an ms in fire protection engineering oklahoma state university offers an abet-accredited bs in fire protection and safety engineering technology established in 1937 eastern kentucky university also offers an abet-accredited bs in fire protection and safety engineering technology the case school of engineering at case western reserve university offers a masters degree track in fire science and engineering and the university of cincinnati offers an associate degree in fire science and a bachelors degree in fire and safety engineering technology as distance learning options the only university in the us and canada to hold this distinction other institutions such as the university of new haven university of kansas illinois institute of technology university of california berkeley eastern kentucky university and the university of texas at austin have offered courses in fire protection engineering or technologycitation needed the practice of final fire sprinkler systems design and hydraulic calculations is commonly performed by design technicians who are often educated in-house at contracting firms throughout north america with the objective of preparing designers for certification by testing by associations such as nicet national institute for certification in engineering technologies nicet certification is commonly used as a proof of competency for securing a license to design and install fire protection systems in europe the university of edinburgh offers a degree in fire engineering and had its first fire research group in the 1970s these activities are now conducted at the new bre centre for fire safety engineering the university of leeds uniquely offers an msc award in fire and explosion engineering other european universities active in the fire engineering are luleå tekniska universitet lund university stordhaugesund university college university of central lancashire university of manchester university of ulster university of sheffield university of greenwich london south bank university university of wales newport letterkenny institute of technology in ireland and otto-von-guericke-universität magdeburg and bergische universität wuppertal in germanycitation needed vilnius gediminas technikal university in lithuania the university of ulster introduced its first fire safety programmes in 1975 followed by the first msc programme in fire safety engineering in the united kingdom introduced in 1990 in 2005 the this msc programme will celebrate 25 years of unbroken service to higher fire fire safety engineering education in 2004 the institute for fire safety engineering and technology at the university of ulster firesert occupied its new fire safety engineering laboratories which were funded by £6 million pound infrastructure award the new facilities are state of the art fire safety engineering laboratories including a large scale burn hall and a 10 megawatt calorimeter in australia victoria university in melbourne offers postgraduate courses in building fire safety and risk engineering as does the university of western sydney the centre for environmental safety and risk engineering cesare is a research unit under victoria university and has facilities for research and testing of fire behaviour professional registration suitably qualified and experienced fire protection engineers may qualify for registration as a professional engineer the recognition of fire protection engineering as a separate discipline varies from state to state in the united states ncees recognizes fire protection engineering as a separate discipline and offers a pe exam subject this test was last updated for the october 2012 exam and includes the following major topics percentages indicate approximate weight of topic fire protection analysis 20% fire protection management 5% fire dynamics 12.5% active and passive systems 50% egress and occupant movement 12.5% few countries outside the united states regulate the professional practice of fire protection engineering as a disciplinecitation needed although they may restrict the use of the title engineer in association with its practice the titles fire engineer and fire safety engineer tend to be preferred outside the united states especially in the united kingdom and commonwealth countries influenced by the british fire service from asia mr jwala sharma president of asian society of safety engineers initiated the formation of fire college in baroda india under the guidance of shri narendra modi prime minister of india on 4 march 2012 in gujarat mr jwala sharma passed out from ies ips fire college indore india currently he resides in india soon he is plan to settle in malaysia for further researches on fire engineering aspects and prevention according to him ignorance in fire prevention is the root and stem of all evils in fire safety the institution of fire engineers is one international organization that qualifies many aspects of the training and qualifications of fire engineers
