ecotechnology ecotechnology is an applied science that seeks to fulfill human needs while causing minimal ecological disrupution by harnessing and manipulating natural forces to leverage their beneficial effects ecotechnology integrates two fields of study the ecology of technics and the technics of ecology requiring an understanding of the structures and processes of ecosystems and societies all sustainable engineering that can reduce damage to ecosystems adopt ecology as a fundamental basis and ensure conservation of biodiversity and sustainable development may be considered as forms of ecotechnology ecotechnology emphasizes approaching a problem from a holistic point of view for example remediation of rivers should not only consider one single area rather the whole catchment area which includes the upstream middle stream and downstream sections should be considered construction can reduce its impact on nature by consulting experts on the environment sustainable development requires the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies which are both efficient and adapted to local conditions ecotechnology allows improvement in economic performance while minimizing harm to the environment by increasing the efficiency in the selection and use of materials and energy sources control of impacts on ecosystems development and permanent improvement of cleaner processes and products eco-marketing introducing environmental management systems in the production and services sectors and development of activities for increasing awareness of the need for environmental protection and promotion of sustainable development by the general public during ecotechnics 95 - international symposium on ecological engineering in Ã¶stersund sweden the participants agreed on the definition ecotechnics is defined as the method of designing future societies within ecological frames
