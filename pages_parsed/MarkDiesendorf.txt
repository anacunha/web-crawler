applied to the solar interior his early postdoctoral research was diverse including the analysis of ground and satellite data on vlf emissions mechanisms of insect smell and vision and biological catalysts from 1975 to 1985 he worked in the csiro division of mathematics the australian national research organisation on topics such as the integration of wind power into electricity grids for a few years around 1980 he was a principal research scientist and leader of the applied mathematics group in csiro he left csiro in 1985 after the organisation had terminated all research on renewable

mitigation especially transitioning electricity supply systems to 100% renewable energy to this end he is involved in scenario development computer simulation modelling and energy policy previously dr diesendorf was one of the leading proponents calling for the ethical scientific debate over public water fluoridation on this issue diesendorf has authored several papers including a major 1986 article entitled the mystery of declining tooth decay in the journal nature examining the need for a scientific re-evaluation of fluoridation and has highlighted some of the contrary evidence books
