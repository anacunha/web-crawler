architectural engineering architectural engineering also known as building engineering is the application of engineering principles and technology to building design and construction definitions of an architectural engineer may refer to an engineer in the structural mechanical electrical construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction a licensed engineering professional in parts of the united states architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings engineering for building structural engineering main article structural engineering structural engineering involves the analysis and design of physical objects buildings bridges equipment supports towers and walls those concentrating on buildings are responsible for the structural performance of a large part of the built environment and are sometimes informally referred to as building engineers structural engineers require expertise in strength of materials and in the seismic design of structures covered by earthquake engineering architectural engineers sometimes structural as one aspect of their designs the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists mechanical electrical and plumbing mep main article mechanical electrical and plumbing mechanical engineering and electrical engineering engineers are specialists commonly referred to as mechanical electrical and plumbing when engaged in the building design fields also known as building services engineering in the united kingdom canada and australia mechanical engineers often design and oversee the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac plumbing and rain gutter systems plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple active fire protection systems but for more complicated projects fire protection engineers are often separately retained electrical engineers are responsible for the buildings power distribution telecommunication fire alarm signalization lightning protection and control systems as well as lighting systems the architectural engineer pe in the united states main article architectural engineer pe in many jurisdictions of the united states the architectural engineer is a licensed engineering professional usually a graduate of an architectural engineering university program preparing students to perform whole-building design in competition with architect-engineer teams or for practice in one of structural mechanical or electrical fields of building design but with an appreciation of integrated architectural requirements formal architectural engineering education following the engineering model of earlier disciplines developed in the late 19th century and became widespread in the united states by the mid-20th century with the establishment of a specific architectural engineering ncees professional engineering registration examination in the 1990s and first offering in april 2003 architectural engineering became recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the united states architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are also licensed as architects the architect as architectural engineer see also architect professional requirements in some countries the practice of architecture includes planning designing and overseeing the buildings construction and architecture as a profession providing architectural services is referred to as architectural engineering in japan a first-class architect plays the dual role of architect and building engineer although the services of a licensed structural design first-class architect are required for buildings over a certain scale in some languages such as korean and arabic architect is literally translated as architectural engineer in some countries an architectural engineer such as the ingegnere edile in italy is entitled to practice architecture and is often referred to as an architect these individuals are often also structural engineers in other countries such as germany austria iran and most of the arab countries architecture graduates receive an engineering degree dipling - diplom-ingenieur in spain an architect has a technical university education and legal powers to carry out building structure and facility projects in brazil architects and engineers used to share the same accreditation process confea - federal council of engineering architecture and agronomy now the brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process cau - architecture and urbanism council besides traditional architecture design training brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training in engineering disciplines such as structural electrical hydraulic and mechanical engineering after graduation architects can be fully responsible for design and construction in these areas except in electric wiring where the architect autonomy is limited to systems up to 30kva applied to buildings urban environment built cultural heritage landscape planning interiorscape planning and regional planning in greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong to the polytechnic university obtaining an engineering diploma they graduate after 5 years of studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members of the technical chamber of greece tee - τεχνικό επιμελητήριο ελλάδος the engineering diploma equals a masters degree in ects units 300 according to the bologna accords education further information engineers degree the architectural structural mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled by completion of a university program architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study main article building engineering education what differentiates architectural engineering from architecture architect as a separate and single integrated field of study compared to other engineering disciplines is its multi-disciplinary engineering approach through training in and appreciation of architecture the field seeks integration of building systems within its overall building design architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac plumbing fire protection electrical lighting architectural acoustics and structural systems in some university programs students are required to concentrate on one of the systems in others they can receive a generalist architectural or building engineering degree
