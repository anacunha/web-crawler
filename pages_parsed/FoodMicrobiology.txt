food microbiology food microbiology is the study of the microorganisms that inhabit create or contaminate food including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage good bacteria however such as probiotics are becoming increasingly important in food science in addition microorganisms are essential for the production of foods such as cheese yogurt bread beer wine and other fermented foods food safety food safety is a major focus of food microbiology pathogenic bacteria viruses and toxins produced by microorganisms are all possible contaminants of food however microorganisms and their products can also be used to combat these pathogenic microbes probiotic bacteria including those that produce bacteriocins can kill and inhibit pathogens alternatively purified bacteriocins such as nisin can be added directly to food products finally bacteriophages viruses that only infect bacteria can be used to kill bacterial pathogens thorough preparation of food including proper cooking eliminates most bacteria and viruses however toxins produced by contaminants may not be liable to change to non-toxic forms by heating or cooking the contaminated food fermentation see also yeast in winemaking fermentation is one of the methods to preserve food and alter its quality yeast especially saccharomyces cerevisiae is used to leaven bread brew beer and make wine certain bacteria including lactic acid bacteria are used to make yogurt cheese hot sauce pickles fermented sausages and dishes such as kimchi a common effect of these fermentations is that the food product is less hospitable to other microorganisms including pathogens and spoilage-causing microorganisms thus extending the foods shelf-life some cheese varieties also require molds to ripen and develop their characteristic flavors microbial biopolymers several microbially produced polymers are used in the food industry alginate alginates can be used as thickening agents although listed here under the category microbial polysaccharides commercial alginates are currently only produced by extraction from brown seaweeds such as laminaria hyperborea or l japonica poly-γ-glutamic acid poly-γ-glutamic acid γ-pga produced by various strains of bacillus has potential applications as a thickener in the food industry food authenticity it is important to be able to detect microorganisms in food in particular pathogenic microorganisms or genetically modified microorganisms food testing main article food sampling to ensure safety of food products microbiological tests such as testing for pathogens and spoilage organisms are required this way the risk of contamination under normal use conditions can be examined and food poisoning outbreaks can be prevented testing of food products and ingredients is important along the whole supply chain as possible flaws of products can occur at every stage of production apart from detecting spoilage microbiological tests can also determine germ content identify yeasts and molds and salmonella for salmonella scientists are also developing rapid and portable technologies capable of identifying unique variants of salmonella polymerase chain reaction pcr is a quick and inexpensive method to generate numbers of copies of a dna fragment at a specific band pcr polymerase chain reaction 2008 for that reason scientists are using pcr to detect different kinds of viruses or bacteria such as hiv and anthrax based on their unique dna patterns various kits are commercially available to help in food pathogen nucleic acids extraction pcr detection and differentiation the detection of bacterial strands in food products is very important to everyone in the world for it helps prevent the occurrence of food borne illness therefore pcr is recognized as a dna detector in order to amplify and trace the presence of pathogenic strands in different processed food
