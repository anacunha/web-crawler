mahoney tables the mahoney tables are a set of reference tables used in architecture used as a guide to climate-appropriate design they are named after architect carl mahoney who worked on them together with john martin evans and otto k√∂nigsberger they were first published in 1971 by the united nations department of economic and social affairs the concept developed by mahoney 1968 in nigeria provided the basis of the mahoney tables later developed by koenigsberger mahoney and evans 1970 published by the united nations in english french and spanish with large sections included in the widely distributed publication by koenigsberger et al 1978 the mahoney tables evans 1999 evans 2001 proposed a climate analysis sequence that starts with the basic and widely available monthly climatic data of temperature humidity and rainfall such as that found in hmso 1958 and pearce and smith 1990 or data published by national meteorological services for example smn 1995 today the data for most major cities can be downloaded directly from the internet from sites such as httpwwwwundergroundcomglobalaghtml 2006 john martin evans the comfort triangles the tables use readily available climate data and simple calculations to give design guidelines in a manner similar to a spreadsheet as opposed to detailed thermal analysis or simulation there are six tables four are used for entering climatic data for comparison with the requirements for thermal comfort and two for reading off appropriate design criteria a rough outline of the table usage is air temperatures the max min and mean temperatures for each month are entered into this table humidity precipitation and wind the max min and mean figures for each month are entered into this table and the conditions for each month classified into a humidity group comparison of comfort conditions and climate the desired maxmin temperatures are entered and compared to the climatic values from table 1 a note is made if the conditions create heat stress or cold stress ie the building will be too hot or cold indicators of humid or arid conditions rules are provided for combining the stress table 3 and humidity groups table 2 to check a box classifying the humidity and aridity for each month for each of six possible indicators the number of months where that indicator was checked are added up giving a yearly total schematic design recommendations the yearly totals in table 4 correspond to rows in this table listing schematic design recommendations eg buildings oriented on east-west axis to reduce sun exposure medium sized openings 20%-40% of wall area design development recommendations again the yearly totals from table 4 are used to read off recommendations eg roofs should be high-mass and well insulated
