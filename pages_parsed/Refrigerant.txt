refrigerant a refrigerant is a substance or mixture usually a fluid used in a heat pump and refrigeration cycle in most cycles it undergoes phase transitions from a liquid to a gas and back again many working fluids have been used for such purposes fluorocarbons especially chlorofluorocarbons became commonplace in the 20th century but they are being phased out because of their ozone depletion effects other common refrigerants used in various applications are ammonia sulfur dioxide and non-halogenated hydrocarbons such as propane the ideal refrigerant would have favorable thermodynamic properties be noncorrosive to mechanical components and be safe including free from toxicity and flammability it would not cause ozone depletion or climate change since different fluids have the desired traits in different degree choice is a matter of trade-off the desired thermodynamic properties are a boiling point somewhat below the target temperature a high heat of vaporization a moderate density in liquid form a relatively high density in gaseous form and a high critical temperature since boiling point and gas density are affected by pressure refrigerants may be made more suitable for a particular application by choice of operating pressures refrigerant environmental issues the inert nature of many halons chlorofluorocarbons cfc and hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfc with the benefits of their being nonflammable and nontoxic made them good choices as refrigerants but their stability in the atmosphere and their corresponding global warming potential and ozone depletion potential raised concerns about their usage in order from the highest to the lowest potential of ozone depletion are bromochlorofluorocarbon cfc then hcfc though hfc and pfc are non-ozone depleting many have global warming potentials that are thousands of times greater than co2 some other refrigerants such as propane and ammonia are not inert and are flammable or toxic if released new refrigerants were developed in the early 21st century that are safer for the environment but their application has been held up due to concerns over toxicity and flammability history early mechanical refrigeration systems employed sulfur dioxide methyl chloride and ammonia being toxic sulfur dioxide and methyl chloride rapidly disappeared from the market with the introduction of cfcs occasionally one may encounter older machines with methyl formate chloromethane or dichloromethane called carrene in the trade chlorofluorocarbons were little used for refrigeration until better synthesis methods developed in the 1950s reduced their cost their domination of the market was called into question in the 1980s by concerns about depletion of the ozone layer following legislative regulations on ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbons cfcs and hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs substances used as substitute refrigerants such as perfluorocarbons fcs and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs have also come under criticism they are currently subject to prohibition discussions on account of their harmful effect on the climate in 1997 fcs and hfcs were included in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention on climate change in 2006 the eu adopted a regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases which makes stipulations regarding the use of fcs and hfcs with the intention of reducing their emissions the provisions do not affect climate-neutral refrigerants uses refrigerants such as ammonia r717 carbon dioxide and non-halogenated hydrocarbons do not deplete the ozone layer and have no ammonia or only a low carbon dioxide hydrocarbons global warming potentialcitation needed they are used in air-conditioning systems for buildings in sport and leisure facilities in the chemicalpharmaceutical industry in the automotive industry and above all in the food industry production storage retailing in these settings their toxicity is less a concern than in home equipment emissions from automobile air conditioning are a growing concern because of their impact on climate changecitation needed from 2011 on the european union will phase out refrigerants with a global warming potential gwp of more than 150 in automotive air conditioning gwp = 100 year warming potential of one kilogram of a gas relative to one kilogram of co2citation needed this will ban potent greenhouse gases such as the refrigerant hfc-134a also known as r-134a in north america which has a gwp of 1410to promote safe and energy-efficient refrigerants one of the most promising alternatives is co2 r-744 carbon dioxide is non-flammable non-ozone depleting has a global warming potential of 1 r-744 can be used as a working fluid in climate control systems for cars residential air conditioning hot water pumps commercial refrigeration and vending machinescitation needed r12 is compatible with mineral oil while r134a is compatible with synthetic oil that contains esterscitation needed gm announced that it would start using hydrofluoroolefin hfo-1234yf in all of its brands by 2013 dimethyl ether dme is also gaining popularity as a refrigerant but like propane it is also dangerously flammable some refrigerants are seeing rising use as recreational drugs leading to an extremely dangerous phenomenon known as inhalant abuse disposal under section 608 of the united states clean air act it is illegal to knowingly release refrigerants into the atmosphere when refrigerants are removed they should be recycled to clean out any contaminants and return them to a usable condition refrigerants should never be mixed together outside of facilities licensed to do so for the purpose of producing blends some refrigerants must be managed as hazardous waste even if recycled and special precautions are required for their transport depending on the legislation of the countrys government various refrigerant reclamation methods are in use to recover refrigerants for reuse refrigerants by class and r-number main article list of refrigerants refrigerants may be divided into three classes according to their manner of absorption or extraction of heat from the substances to be refrigeratedcitation needed class 1 this class includes refrigerants that cool by phase change typically boiling using the refrigerants latent heat class 2 these refrigerants cool by temperature change or sensible heat the quantity of heat being the specific heat capacity x the temperature change they are air calcium chloride brine sodium chloride brine alcohol and similar nonfreezing solutions the purpose of class 2 refrigerants is to receive a reduction of temperature from class 1 refrigerants and convey this lower temperature to the area to be air-conditioned class 3 this group consists of solutions that contain absorbed vapors of liquefiable agents or refrigerating media these solutions function by nature of their ability to carry liquefiable vapors which produce a cooling effect by the absorption of their heat of solution they can also be classified into many categories the r- numbering system was developed by dupont corporation which owns the freon trademark and systematically identifies the molecular structure of refrigerants made with a single halogenated hydrocarbon the meaning of the codes is as followscitation needed for saturated hydrocarbons subtracting 90 from the concatenated numbers of carbon hydrogen and fluorine atoms respectively gives the assigned r remaining bonds not accounted for are occupied by chlorine atoms a suffix of a lower-case letter a b or c indicates increasingly unsymmetrical isomers for example r-134a has 2 carbon atoms 2 hydrogen atoms and 4 fluorine atoms an empirical formula of tetrafluoroethane the a suffix indicates that the isomer is unbalanced by one atom giving 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane r-134 without the a suffix would have a molecular structure of 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethanea compound not especially effective as a refrigerantcitation needed the r-400 series is made up of zeotropic blends those where the boiling point of constituent compounds differs enough to lead to changes in relative concentration because of fractional distillation and the r-500 series is made up of so-called azeotropic blends the rightmost digit is assigned arbitrarily by ashrae an industry organization the r-700 series is made up of non-organic refrigerants also designated by ashrae the same numbers are used with an r- prefix for generic refrigerants with a propellant prefix eg propellant 12 for the same chemical used as a propellant for an aerosol spray and with trade names for the compounds such as freon 12 recently a practice of using hfc- for hydrofluorocarbons cfc- for chlorofluorocarbons and hcfc- for hydrochlorofluorocarbons has arisen because of the regulatory differences among these groupscitation needed notable blends below are some notable blended hfc mixtures there exist many more see list of refrigerants all r-400 r-4xx and r-500 r-5xx

air-conditioning andor cooling the reason why air is not more widely used as a general-purpose refrigerant because there is no change of phase and is therefore too inefficient to be practical in most applications it has been suggested that with suitable compression and expansion technology air can be a practical albeit not the most efficient refrigerant free of the possibility of environmental contamination or damage and almost completely harmless to plants and animals an explosion could result from refrigerant-type compressor lubricating oils being compressed together with the air air is so frequently used as a coolant that air cooling is seldom mentioned in this context due to the low boiling point of its constituents air is less often used as a refrigerant water as a refrigerant further information evaporative cooler water - natural non toxic low cost environmentally friendly and widely available is widely used in water cooling and if evaporated in the process may be called a refrigerant water also commonly serves as a heat transfer and storage material and in large systems it may actually fill all of these roles further information hvac the simplest and lowest cost open-cycle cooling systems known as swamp coolers in the south-west united states do not even need power for a compressor merely a blower fan - humidified air is simply vented to the living space portable free standing units can be obtained at discount stores for less than $200us however drawbacks of these systems if improperly implemented are multiple and severe the total cooling power of the unit is limited by the fact that neither coolant nor air can be recirculated if the cooling unit does not have a supply of fresh dry air and the waste air is not effectively vented stagnant humid air will make the space more uncomfortable than if it were merely ventilated further information thermal comfort an additional limitation of such systems would be that if the air outside is already humid cooling power is severely limited this is why such units are not found in areas of frequent and high humidity such as the south-east united states if the temperature outside is severely hot such as over 110 째f or 43 째c the simple unit will not cool the air sufficiently for comfort even if the dew point outside is very low in these instances more complex systems such as two stage indirect-direct or hybrid will be needed while all the drawbacks can be addressed in various ways the complexity and initial cost of these systems increases to the point that the installation cost comes into competition with freon based direct cooling systems at this price point direct cooling systems are often chosen even though the long term energy cost of evaporative systems may be lower
