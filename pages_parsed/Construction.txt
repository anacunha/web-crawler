construction for other uses see construction disambiguation construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser while construction typically takes place on location for a known client construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries construction starts with planningcitation needed design and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use large-scale construction requires collaboration across multiple disciplines an architect normally manages the job and a construction manager design engineer construction engineer or project manager supervises it for the successful execution of a project effective planning is essential those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements the environmental impact of the job the successful scheduling budgeting construction-site safety availability and transportation of building materials logistics inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding etc the largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects etymology construction is a general term meaning the art and science to form objects systems or organizations and comes from latin constructionem from com- together and struere to pile up and old french construction construction is used as a verb the act of building and a noun how a building was built the nature of its structure types of construction in general there are three sectors of construction buildings infrastructure and industrial building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential commercialinstitutional infrastructure is often called heavyhighway heavy civil or heavy engineering it includes large public works dams bridges highways waterwastewater and utility distribution industrial includes refineries process chemical power generation mills and manufacturing plants there are other ways to break the industry into sectors or markets engineering news-record enr is a trade magazine for the construction industry each year enr compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies they publish a list of the largest companies in the united states top-40 and also a list the largest global firms top-250 by amount of work they are doing outside their home country in 2014 enr compiled the data in nine market segments it was divided as transportation petroleum buildings power industrial water manufacturing sewerwaste telecom hazardous waste plus a tenth category for other projects in their reporting on the top 400 they used data on transportation sewer hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction to recognize the differences of companies in this sector it is divided into three subsectors building construction heavy and civil engineering construction and specialty trade contractors there are also categories for construction service firms eg engineering architecture and construction managers firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project building construction building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings the majority of building construction jobs are small renovations such as addition of a room or renovation of a bathroom often the owner of the property acts as laborer paymaster and design team for the entire project although building construction projects typically include various common elements such as design financial estimating and legal considerations many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results such as structural collapse cost overruns andor litigation for this reason those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome commercial building construction is procured privately or publicly utilizing various delivery methodologies including cost estimating hard bid negotiated price traditional management contracting construction management-at-risk design build and design-build bridging residential construction practices technologies and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used eg brick versus stone versus timber cost of construction on a per square meter or per square foot basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions local regulations economies of scale custom designed homes are often more expensive to build and the availability of skilled tradespeople as residential construction as well as all other types of construction can generate a lot of waste careful planning again is needed here residential construction the most popular method of residential construction in north america is wood-framed construction typical construction steps for a single-family or small multi-family house are develop floor plans and obtain a materials list for estimations more recently performed with estimating software obtain government building approval if necessary clear the building site survey to stake out for the foundation excavate the foundation and dig footers pour a foundation and footers with concrete build the main load-bearing structure out of thick pieces of wood and possibly metal i-beams for large spans with few supports see framing construction add floor and ceiling joists and install subfloor panels cover outer walls and roof in osb or plywood and a water-resistive barrier install roof shingles or other covering for flat roof cover the walls with siding typically vinyl wood or brick veneer but possibly stone or other materials install windows frame interior walls with wooden 2x4s add internal plumbing hvac electrical and natural gas utilities building inspector visits if necessary to approve utilities and framing install insulation and interior drywall panels cementboard for wet areas and to complete walls and ceilings install bathroom fixtures spackle prime and paint interior walls and ceilings additional tiling on top of cementboard for wet areas such as the bathroom and kitchen backsplash install final floor covering such as floor tile carpet or wood flooring install major appliances unless the original owners are building the house at this point it is typically sold or rented new construction techniques and sustainability as efficiency codes have come into effect in recent years new construction technologies and methods have emerged university construction management departments are on the cutting edge of the newest methods of construction intended to improve efficiency performance and reduce construction waste new techniques of building construction are being researched made possible by advances in 3d printing technology in a form of additive building construction similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities in one continuous build using large 3d printers working versions of 3d-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres 6 ft 7 in of building material per hour as of january 2013update with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres 11 ft per hour sufficient to complete a building in a week dutch architect janjaap ruijssenaarss performative architecture 3d-printed building is scheduled to be built in 2014 in the current trend of sustainable construction the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops smart growth architectural tradition and classical design this is in contrast to modernist and short-lived globally uniform architecture as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl both trends started in the 1980s the construction site may be shut down due to bad weather erecting scaffolded tents over the site may reduce the number of lost work days increasing productivity construction processes design team in the modern industrialized world construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts the design usually consists of drawings and specifications usually prepared by a design team including architect civil engineers mechanical engineers electrical engineers structural engineers fire protection engineers planning consultants architectural consultants and archaeological consultants the design team is most commonly employed by ie in contract with the property owner under this system once the design is completed by the design team a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work either based directly on the design or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor following evaluation of bids the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder the modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties especially among large firms in the past architects interior designers engineers developers construction managers and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies even in the larger firms presently a firm that is nominally an architecture or construction management firm may have experts from all related fields as employees or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill thus each such firm may offer itself as one-stop shopping for a construction project from beginning to end this is designated as a design build contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction while adhering to the performance specifications several project structures can assist the owner in this integration including design-build partnering and construction management in general each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects interior designers engineers and constructors throughout design and construction in response many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process the increasing complexity of construction projects creates the need for design professionals trained in all phases of the projects life-cycle and develop an appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system requiring close integration of many sub-systems and their individual components including sustainability building engineering is an emerging discipline that attempts to meet this new challenge financial advisors construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time can arise even when the overall total is enough fraud is a problem in many fields but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project mortgage bankers accountants and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely even in relatively small projects since the owners equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid large projects can involve highly complex financial plans and often start with a conceptual estimate performed by a building estimator as portions of a project are completed they may be sold supplanting one lender or owner for another while the logistical requirements of having the right trades and materials available for each stage of the building construction project carries forward in many english-speaking countries but not the united states projects typically use quantity surveyors legal aspects main article construction law a construction project must fit into the legal framework governing the property these include governmental regulations on the use of propertyand obligations that are created in the process of construction the project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad - bridge collapses or explosions other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations or things that are a matter of custom or expectation such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable the bridge design will not cause a collapse or that the custom is no longer needed acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations each of which all parties must carefully consider a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible the time element in construction means that a delay costs money and in cases of bottlenecks the delay can be extremely expensive thus the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse legal advisors in the beginning of a construction project seek to identify ambiguities and other potential sources of trouble in the contract structure and to present options for preventing problems throughout the process of the project they work to avoid and resolve conflicts that arise in each case the lawyer facilitates an exchange of obligations that matches the reality of the project interaction of expertise design finance and legal aspects overlap and interrelate the design must be not only structurally sound and appropriate for the use and location but must also be financially possible to build and legal to use the financial structure must accommodate the need for building the design provided and must pay amounts that are legally owed the legal structure must integrate the design into the surrounding legal framework and enforce the financial consequences of the construction process procurement procurement describes the merging of activities undertaken by the client to obtain a building there are many different methods of construction procurement however the three most common types of procurement are traditional design-bid-build design-build and management contracting there is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project new forms include partnering such as public-private partnering ppps aka private finance initiatives pfis and alliances such as pure or project alliances and impure or strategic alliances the focus on co-operation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry traditional main article design-bid-build this is the most common method of construction procurement and is well established and recognized in this arrangement the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator his or her role is to design the works prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings administer the contract tender the works and manage the works from inception to completion there are direct contractual links between the architects client and the main contractor any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor the procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy design-build main article design-build this approach has become more common in recent years and involves the client contracting a single entity to both provide a design and to build that design in some cases the design-build package can also include finding the site arranging funding and applying for all necessary statutory consents the owner produces a list of requirements for a project giving an overall view of the projects goals several db contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals the owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor often it is not just one contractor but a consortium of several contractors working together once these have been hired they begin building the first phase of the project as they build phase 1 they design phase 2 this is in contrast to a design-bid-build contract where the project is completely designed by the owner then bid on then completed kent hansen pointed out that state departments of transportation usually use design build contracts as a way of progressing projects when states lack the skills-resources in such departments design build contracts are usually employed for very large projects management procurement systems main article construction management in this arrangement the client plays an active role in the procurement system by entering into separate contracts with the designer architect or engineer the construction manager and individual trade contractors the client takes on the contractual role while the construction or project manager provides the active role of managing the separate trade contracts and ensuring that they complete all work smoothly and effectively together management procurement systems are often used to speed up the procurement processes allow the client greater flexibility in design variation throughout the contract give the ability to appoint individual work contractors separate contractual responsibility on each individual throughout the contract and to provide greater client control authority having jurisdiction see also planning permission in construction the authority having jurisdiction ahj is the governmental agency or sub-agency that regulates the construction process in most cases this is the municipality where the building is located however construction performed for supra-municipal authorities are usually regulated directly by the owning authority which becomes the ahj before the foundation can be dug contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services this lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical water sewage phone and cable facilities which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations during the construction of a building the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed an occupancy permit may be issued an operating building must remain in compliance with the fire code the fire code is enforced by the local fire department or a municipal code enforcement office changes made to a building that affect safety including its use expansion structural integrity and fire protection items usually require approval of the ahj for review concerning the building code industry characteristics in the united states the industry in 2014 has around $960 billion in annual revenue according to statistics tracked by the census bureau of which $680 billion is private split evenly between residential and nonresidential and the remainder is government as of 2005 there were about 667,000 firms employing 1 million contractors 200,000 general contractors 38,000 heavy and 432,000 specialty the average contractor employed fewer than 10 employees as a whole the industry employed an estimated 5.8 million as of april 2013 with a 13.2% unemployment rate in the united states approximately 828,000 women were employed in the construction industry as of 2011 careers there are many routes to the different careers within the construction industry these three main tiers are based on educational background and training which vary by country unskilled and semi-skilled - general site labor with little or no construction qualifications skilled - tradesmen whove served apprenticeships typically in labor unions and on-site managers who possess extensive knowledge and experience in their craft or profession technical and management - personnel with the greatest educational qualifications usually graduate degrees trained to design manage and instruct the construction process skilled occupations include carpenters electricians plumbers ironworkers masons and many other manual crafts as well as those involved in project management in the uk these require further education qualifications often in vocational subject areas these qualifications are either obtained directly after the completion of compulsory education or through on the job apprenticeship training in the uk 8500 construction-related apprenticeships were commenced in 2007 technical and specialized occupations require more training as a greater technical knowledge is required these professions also hold more legal responsibility a short list of the main careers with an outline of the educational requirements are given below architect - typically holds 1 undergraduate 3 year degree in architecture + 1 post-graduate 2 year degree diparch or barch in architecture plus 24 months experience within the industry to use the title architect the individual must be registered on the architects registration board register of architects civil engineer - typically holds a degree in a related subject the chartered engineer qualification is controlled by the engineering council and is often achieved through membership of the institution of civil engineers a new university graduate must hold a masters degree to become chartered persons with bachelors degrees may become an incorporated engineer building services engineer - often referred to as an me engineer typically holds a degree in mechanical or electrical engineering chartered engineer status is governed by the engineering council mainly through the chartered institution of building services engineers project manager - typically holds a 4-year or greater higher education qualification but are often also qualified in another field such as architecture civil engineering or quantity surveying structural engineer - typically holds a bachelors or masters degree in structural engineering a peng is required from the professional engineers ontario canada new university graduates must hold a masters degree to gain chartered status from the engineering council mainly through the institution of structural engineers uk quantity surveyor - typically holds a bachelors degree in quantity surveying chartered status is gained from the royal institution of chartered surveyors civil estimators are professionals who typically have a background in civil engineering construction project management or construction supervision in 2010 a salary survey revealed the differences in remuneration between different roles sectors and locations in the construction and built environment industry the results showed that areas of particularly strong growth in the construction industry such as the middle east yield higher average salaries than in the uk for example the average earning for a professional in the construction industry in the middle east across all sectors job types and levels of experience is £42,090 compared to £26,719 in the uk this trend is not necessarily due to the fact that more affluent roles are available however as architects with 14 or more years experience working in the middle east earn on average £43,389 per annum compared to £40,000 in the uk some construction workers in the uscanada have made more than $100,000 annually depending on their trade safety see also construction site safety construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union in 2009 the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the united states was nearly three times that for all workers falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution transportation accidents and trench cave-ins other safety risks for workers in construction include hearing loss due to high noise exposure musculoskeletal injury chemical exposure and high levels of stress history main article history of construction see also history of architecture the first huts and shelters were constructed by hand or with simple tools as cities grew during the bronze age a class of professional craftsmen like bricklayers and carpenters appeared occasionally slaves were used for construction work in the middle ages these were organized into guilds in the 19th century steam-powered machinery appeared and later diesel- and electric powered vehicles such as cranes excavators and bulldozers fast-track construction has been increasingly popular in the 21st century some estimates suggest that 40% of construction projects are now fast-track construction construction phases visionfantasyidea - a concept never intended to be built may be an aesthetic or structural design exercise proposed - a building concept that is under review by the building owner and by government approved - a building concept that will be constructed in the near future if the proposed building is not approved then the proposal may be amended and resubmitted or it may be deferred or cancelled design - the specification of what is to be built in sufficient detail to be used as the basis as a contract between the owner and a contractor procurement - the selection of the contractor or contractors to carry out the construction this may be by competitive tendering diversions - before construction can start any services on the site which must be kept operational to serve other adjacent sites must be diverted so they run outside the footprint of the new building this can include drainage water and gas piped services and power and communication cables under-construction - a fully designed building currently being built ground works - construction work below ground level including the construction of basements and foundations topped-out - a fully designed building where construction has reached the highest point of the building fitting out - installation of the decorative non-structural elements once the building main structure is complete this includes painting ceilings light fittings etc commissioning or setting to work - once the building mechanical electrical plumbing communications and building control systems are installed they then need to be tested and adjusted so they deliver the required performancein modern buildings this can take some time during which little seems to be going on but if this is not done properly then these systems will not deliver their design performance leading to hot and cold spots spurious alarms higher energy bills and systems failing during emergencies substantial completion beneficial occupancy - a point when the work is sufficiently complete so that the owner can occupy items noted during inspection punch list or snag list may still be corrected completebuilt - a fully designed building that has been fully built excluding future expansions punch list items all completed building operation - all those day-to-day activities need to ensure the building can be used in simple buildings this means little more than cleaning but in more complicated buildings this is a large scale operation employing a large team of staff if they do their job right then you hardly notice them maintenance - works to ensure the building continues to operate in accordance with its design including replacing elements which are approaching the end of their useful life repair - replacing building elements which have been damaged or which have failed to restore the building to its as-built state renovation - modification to the building this can be minor modifications that are carried out while the building is occupied or major works where only the structural elements are kept and the building is out of use for years demolition - destruction of the building which may include the salvage of some elements for reuse elsewhere list of countries by the largest output in construction
