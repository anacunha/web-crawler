what would become cambridge was chosen in december 1630 because it was located safely upriver from boston harbor which made it easily defensible from attacks by enemy ships thomas dudley his daughter anne bradstreet and her husband simon were among the first settlers of the town the first houses were built in the spring of 1631 the settlement was initially referred to as the newe towne official massachusetts records show the name capitalized as newe towne by 1632 and a single word newtowne by 1638 located at the first convenient charles river crossing west of boston newe towne was one of a number of towns including boston dorchester watertown and weymouth founded by the 700 original puritan colonists of the massachusetts bay colony under governor john winthrop the original village site is in the heart of todays harvard square the marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of john f kennedy jfk and winthrop

cambridge was chosen for the site of the new college by the great and general court the massachusetts legislatureprimarily according to testimony by cotton mather to be near the highly respected popular puritan preacher thomas shepard by 1638 the name newe towne had compacted by usage into newtowne in may 1638 the name was changed to cambridge in honor of the university in cambridge england thomas shepard the minister of cambridges church harvards first president henry dunster its first benefactor john harvard and the first schoolmaster nathaniel eaton were all cambridge university alumni as was the then ruling and first governor of the massachusetts bay colony john winthrop in 1629 winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of boston which was known as the cambridge agreement after the university it was governor thomas dudley who in 1650 signed the charter creating the corporation which still governs harvard college cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles 13 km by road from boston the capital of the colony by the american revolution most residents lived near the common and harvard college with farms and estates comprising most of the town most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original puritan colonists but there was also a small elite of anglican worthies who were not involved in village life who made their livings from estates investments and trade and lived in mansions along the road to watertown todays brattle street still known as tory row in 1775 george washington came up from virginia to take command of fledgling volunteer american soldiers camped on the cambridge commontoday called the birthplace of the us army the name of todays nearby sheraton commander hotel refers to that event most of the tory estates were confiscated after the revolution on january 24 1776 henry knox arrived with artillery captured from fort ticonderoga which enabled washington to drive the british army out of boston between 1790 and 1840 cambridge began to grow rapidly with the construction of the west boston bridge in 1792 that connected cambridge directly to boston making it no longer necessary to travel eight miles 13 km through the boston neck roxbury and brookline to cross the charles river a second bridge the canal bridge opened in 1809 alongside the new middlesex canal the new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential districts in the mid-19th century cambridge was the center of a literary revolution when it gave the country a new identity through poetry and literature cambridge was home to some of the famous fireside poetsso called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires in their day the fireside poetshenry wadsworth longfellow james russell lowell and oliver wendell holmeswere as popular and influential as rock stars are todaycitation needed soon after turnpikes were built the cambridge and concord turnpike todays broadway and concord ave the middlesex turnpike hampshire st and massachusetts ave northwest of porter square and what are todays cambridge main and harvard streets were roads to connect various areas of cambridge to the bridges in addition railroads crisscrossed the town during the same era leading to the development of porter square as well as the creation of neighboring town somerville from the formerly rural parts of charlestown cambridge was incorporated as a city in 1846 this was despite noticeable tensions between east cambridge cambridgeport and old cambridge that stemmed from differences in each areas culture sources of income and the national origins of the residents the citys commercial center began to shift from harvard square to central square which became the downtown of the city around this time between 1850 and 1900 cambridge took on much of its present characterstreetcar suburban development along the turnpikes with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on east cambridge comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in cambridgeport and mid-cambridge and upper-class enclaves near harvard university and on the minor hills of the city the coming of the railroad to north cambridge and northwest cambridge then led to three major changes in the city the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between massachusetts ave concord ave and alewife brook the ice-cutting industry launched by frederic tudor on fresh pond and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industries for many decades the citys largest employer was the new england glass company founded in 1818 by the middle of the 19th century it was the largest and most modern glassworks in the world in 1888 all production was moved by edward drummond libbey to toledo ohio where it continues today under the name owens illinois flint glassware with heavy lead content produced by that company is prized by antique glass collectors today there is none on public display in cambridge but there is a large collection in the toledo museum of art there are also a few pieces in the museum of fine arts boston and in the sandwich glass museum on cape cod by 1920 cambridge was one of the main industrial cities of new england with nearly 120,000 residents among the largest businesses located in cambridge during the period of industrialization was the firm of carters ink company whose neon sign long adorned the charles river and which was for many years the largest manufacturer of ink in the world next door was the atheneum press confectionery and snack manufacturers in the cambridgeport-area 4-kendall corridor included the kennedy biscuit factory later part of nabisco and originator of the fig newton necco squirrel brands george close company 1861-1930s daggett

massachusetts and the new england glass company 1818-1878 were among the industrial manufacturers in what are now the kendall square and east cambridge neighborhoods as industry in new england began to decline during the great depression and after world war ii cambridge lost much of its industrial base it also began the transition to being an intellectual rather than an industrial center harvard university had always been important in the city both as a landowner and as an institution but it began to play a more dominant role in the citys life and culture when radcliffe college was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nations most academically talented female students also the move of the massachusetts institute of technology from boston in 1916 ensured cambridges status as an intellectual center of the united states after the 1950s the citys population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples the 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups creating software such as visicalc and lotus 1-2-3 and advanced computers but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and dos-based systems the city continues to be home to many startups as well as a thriving biotech industry which includes headquarters for biogen and genzyme and laboratories for novartis kendall square continued to be a major software hub through the dot-com boom and today hosts offices of major technology companies including google microsoft amazoncom and akamai headquarters by the end of the 20th century cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the northeastern united statescitation needed while maintaining much diversity in class race and age it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to stay the end of rent control in 1994 prompted many cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable in somerville and other communities in 2005 a reassessment of residential property values resulted in a disproportionate number of houses owned by non-affluent people jumping in value relative to other houses with hundreds having their property tax increased by over 100% this forced many homeowners in cambridge to move elsewhere as of 2012update cambridges mix of amenities and proximity to boston has kept housing prices relatively stable despite the bursting of the united states housing bubblecitation needed cambridge has been a sanctuary city since 1985 and reaffirmed its status as such in
