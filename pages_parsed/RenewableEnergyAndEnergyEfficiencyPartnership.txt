renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership reeep is a vienna-based non-profit non-governmental organisation that aims to accelerate the marketplace for renewable energy and energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on the emerging markets and developing countries its primary focus is the scaling up of clean energy business models reeep was originally launched by the government of the united kingdom along with other partners at the johannesburg world summit on sustainable development wssd in august 2002 it pursues its market catalyst role in three ways funding small-to-medium scale project interventions that address the barriers to market development and assist business models in scaling up providing internet-based information resources such as wwwreegleinfo an information portal for clean energy that is funded jointly with ren21 connecting and supporting champions of clean energy via several sub-networks of stakeholders to date the organisation has been funded primarily by governments including australia austria canada germany ireland italy spain switzerland the netherlands the united kingdom the united states and the european commission origins in 2002 accelerating the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was one of the priorities of a large group of countries at the wssd margaret beckett then uk minister for the environment announced the initiative to form reeep at the summits closing session it grew from an agreement with other committed governments businesses and ngos to deliver wssd commitments others in particular to take forward the key recommendations of the g8 renewable energy task force from january 2003 until may 2004 the reeep was housed within the uk foreign and commonwealth office fco where it continued following the un type ii partnership process of stakeholder consultation in june 2004 reeep obtained formal legal non-profit status as an ngo and has since been located at the un complex in vienna austria project interventions since its inception as an independent entity reeep has offered funding to more than 180 projects the majority have targeted emerging markets such as india china south africa and brazil to date reeep projects have addressed two key barriers to clean energy development policy and regulation promoting clear government policies and favourable transparent and stable regulatory frameworks that will encourage long-term investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency innovative finance and business models supporting new forms of financing risk mitigation and business models to make small-sized renewable and energy efficient projects bankable policy and regulation reeep finances projects which promote policy and regulatory frameworks that provide stable long-term conditions for market development but does not promote a one size fits all approach examples of projects funded in this area include a undp initiative to formulate a renewable energy law in kazakhstan passed in june 2009 the drafting of an energy framework for namibia that includes favourable provisions for renewable energy and energy efficient technologies establishing the mechanics for the interstate trading of renewable energy certificates recs in india a roadmap showing what proportion of chinas 2030 energy needs could be met with renewables innovative financing and business models the economics of renewables and energy efficiency - the size the cost structure and the longer return of investment - make it necessary to develop special finance mechanisms particularly in emerging markets and developing countries reeep supports projects that create new sources of finance with local institutions as well as projects that develop ways to expand small projects to a bankable size leverage local capital markets reduce transaction costs and manage risk examples of projects funded in this area include the creation of the e+co west africa modern energy fund to mobilise $12 million in investment in 76 clean energy small and medium-sized enterprises in ghana mali and senegal the establishment of a retail supply chain for clean energy appliances such as solar-powered led lanterns in rural villages of karnataka state in india the expansion of the private financing advisory network pfan a coaching and investor matchmaking service for small clean energy entrepreneurs to include mozambique and uganda support for simpa networks a company which offers a pay-as-you go energy solution that combines hardware embedded into a solar system with software enabling a consumer to buy prepaid energy credits using a mobile phone the implementation of energy efficiency improvements in textile factories in china who supply major international brands such as adidas and hm programme cycle overview since its founding as an independent entity reeep has disbursed a total of €18.6 million of its own funds on 185 projects and attracted an additional €36.3 million in project co-funding from 2003 to 2005 prior to reeeps founding as an independent entity its first and second programme cycles funded 48 projects via the global opportunities fund gof of the uk foreign and commonwealth office fco under the reeep banner the third programme cycle was the first to be independently managed by reeep a total of 18 projects were selected for funding during the year 2005-6 reeep operates on a financial year that runs from 1 april to 30 march in 2006-7 the fourth and fifth programme cycles saw a shift in funding from renewable energy to energy efficiency and a focus on africa 28 projects reached the implementation stage the sixth programme cycle funded 35 projects in july 2007 and the seventh cycle followed in may 2009 funding a further 48 in june 2011 reeep announced the funding of 25 projects in its 8th programme cycle targeting brazil china india indonesia south africa and selected sub-saharan african countries in addition to reeep-funded projects during autumn 2011 reeep issued a joint call for proposals with the opec fund for international development ofid specifically targeting energy access in least developed countries in february 2012 the funding of three rural energy access projects in cambodia ethiopia and tanzania was announced 9th programme cycle on 9 january 2013 reeep announced that it will fund 28 new projects in its 9th funding cycle these were selected from 98 final proposals and cover five thematic areas scaling up successful business models supporting off-grid generation harnessing the benefits of clean energy in both food production and in reliable water supply and opening up energy data in emerging markets internet-based resources reegleinfo reegle with a lower-case r is a clean energy information portal designed to provide easy access to highly reliable information on renewable energy and energy efficiency the website draws information from eight different open data sources such as the world bank undata openei the cia factbook and the reeep sustainable energy regulation network publications to provide understanding of energy issues the portal has four main components country energy profiles that bring energy statistics together with current policies regulations and stakeholder contact information together in one single dossier for each nation a climate change glossary and thesaurus covering the broad fields of climate change mitigation adaptation international development incorporating 1,700 terms with links to synonyms as well as broader and narrower terms a clean energy web search which offers a mind map based search refinement a catalogue of key stakeholders involved in renewable energy and energy efficiency this contains information and links to governmental ministries companies and other green organisations cross-referenced by geographical area and subject matter reegle was developed by reeep in collaboration with ren21 and was funded by the governments of germany netherlands united kingdom as of march 2012 the website attracted an average of 220,000 users per month during 2011 59% of its users came from africa and asia underlining the sites character as an information resource for developing countries and emerging markets reegle is an advocate of the linked open data movement which
