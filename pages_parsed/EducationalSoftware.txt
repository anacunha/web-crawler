educational software see also list of educational software educational software is computer software the primary purpose of which is teaching or self-learning history 1940s - 1970s the use of computer hardware and software in education and training dates to the early 1940s when american researchers developed flight simulators which used analog computers to generate simulated onboard instrument data one such system was the type19 synthetic radar trainer built in 1943 from these early attempts in the wwii era through the mid-1970s educational software was directly tied to the hardware usually mainframe computers on which it ran pioneering educational computer systems in this era included the plato system 1960 developed at the university of illinois and ticcit 1969 in 1963 ibm had established a partnership with stanford universitys institute for mathematical studies in the social sciences imsss directed by patrick suppes to develop the first comprehensive cai elementary school curriculum which was implemented on a large scale in schools in both california and mississippi in 1967 computer curriculum corporation ccc now pearson education technologies was formed to market to schools the materials developed through the ibm partnership early terminals that ran educational systems cost over $10,000 putting them out of reach of most institutions some programming languages from this period particularly basic 1963 and logo 1967 can also be considered educational as they were specifically targeted to students and novice computer users the plato iv system released in 1972 supported many features which later became standard in educational software running on home computers its features included bitmap graphics primitive sound generation and support for non-keyboard input devices including the touchscreen 1970s - 1980s the arrival of the personal computer with the altair 8800 in 1975 changed the field of software in general with specific implications for educational software whereas users prior to 1975 were dependent upon university or government owned mainframe computers with timesharing users after this shift could create and use software for computers in homes and schools computers available for less than $2000 by the early 1980s the availability of personal computers including the apple ii 1977 commodore pet 1977 commodore vic-20 1980 and commodore 64 1982 allowed for the creation of companies and nonprofits which specialized in educational software br√∏derbund and the learning company are key companies from this period and mecc the minnesota educational computing consortium a key non-profit software developer these and other companies designed a range of titles for personal computers with the bulk of the software initially developed for the apple ii 1990s major developments in educational software in the early and mid-1990s were made possible by advances in computer hardware multimedia graphics and sound were increasingly used in educational programs cd-roms became the preferred method for content delivery with several digital encyclopedias released as multimedia application cd-roms with the spread of the internet in the second half of the 1990s new methods of educational software delivery appeared in the history of virtual learning environments the 1990s were a time of growth for educational software systems primarily due to the advent of the affordable computer and of the internet today higher education institutions use virtual learning environments like blackboard inc to provide greater accessibility to learners types courseware courseware is a term that combines the words course with software its meaning originally was used to describe additional educational material intended as kits for teachers or trainers or as tutorials for students usually packaged for use with a computer the terms meaning and usage has expanded and can refer to the entire course and any additional material when used in reference an online or computer formatted classroom many companies are using the term to describe the entire package consisting of one class or course bundled together with the various lessons tests and other material needed the courseware itself can be in different formats some are only available online such as html pages while others can be downloaded in pdf files or other types of document files many forms of educational technology are now being blended with the term courseware most leading educational companies solicit or include courseware with their training packages classroom aids see also interactive whiteboard some educational software is designed for use in school classrooms typically such software may be projected onto a large whiteboard at the front of the class andor run simultaneously on a network of desktop computers in a classroom this type of software is often called classroom management software while teachers often choose to use educational software from other categories in their it suites eg reference works childrens software a whole category of educational software has grown up specifically intended to assist classroom teaching branding has been less strong in this category than in those oriented towards home users software titles are often very specialized and produced by various manufacturers including many established educational book publishers assessment software with the impact of environmental damage and the need for institutions to become paperless more educational institutions are seeking alternative ways of assessment and testing which has always traditionally been known to use up vasts amount of paper assessment software refers to software with a primary purpose of assessing and testing students in a virtual environment assessment software allows students to complete tests and examinations using a computer usually networked the software then scores each test transcript and outputs results for each student assessment software is available in various delivery methods the most popular being self-hosted software online software and hand-held voting systems proprietary software and open-source software systems are available while technically falling into the courseware category see above skill evaluation lab is an example for computer-based assessment software with ppa-2 plan prove assess methodology to create and conduct computer based online examination moodle is an example of open-source software with an assessment component that is gaining popularity other popular international assessment systems include questionmark evalunet xt and questbase reference software main article reference software many publishers of print dictionaries and encyclopedias have been involved in the production of educational reference software since the mid-1990s they were joined in the reference software market by both startup companies and established software publishers most notably microsoft the first commercial reference software products were reformulations of existing content into cd-rom editions often supplemented with new multimedia content including compressed video and sound more recent products made use of internet technologies to supplement cd-rom products then more recently to replace them entirely wikipedia and its offspins such as wiktionary marked a new departure in educational reference software previously encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists the wiki concept has allowed for the development of collaborative reference works through open cooperation incorporating experts and non-experts custom platforms some manufacturers regarded normal personal computers as an inappropriate platform for learning software for younger children and produced custom child-friendly pieces of hardware instead the hardware and software is generally combined into a single product such as a child laptop-lookalike the laptop keyboard for younger children follows an alphabetic order and the qwerty order for the older ones the most well-known example are leapfrog products these include imaginatively designed hand-held consoles with a variety of pluggable educational game cartridges and book-like electronic devices into which a variety of electronic books can be loaded these products are more portable than general laptop computers but have a much more limited range of purposes concentrating on literacy corporate training and tertiary education earlier educational software for the important corporate and tertiary education markets was designed to run on a single desktop computer or an equivalent user device in the years immediately following 2000 planners decided to switch to server-based applications with a high degree of standardization this means that educational software runs primarily on servers which may be hundreds or thousands of miles from the actual user the user only receives tiny pieces of a learning module or test fed over the internet one by one the server software decides on what learning material to distribute collects results and displays progress to teaching staff another way of expressing this change is to say that educational software morphed into an online educational service us governmental endorsements and approval systems ensured the rapid switch to the new way of managing and distributing learning material see also scorm virtual learning environment lms learning management system web-based training specific educational purposes there are highly specific niche markets for educational software including teacher tools and classroom management software remote control and monitoring software filetransfer

make classes more interactive and assists students with studying essays and projects notetaking comparison of notetaking software software for enabling simulated dissection of human and animal bodies used in medical and veterinary college courses spelling tutor software typing tutors medical and healthcare educational software some operating systems and mobile phones have videogames to teach users how to use the system a notable example is microsoft solitaire which was developed to familiarize users with the use of graphical user interfaces especially the mouse and the drag-and-drop technique operating systems while mainstream operating systems are designed for general usages and are more or less customized for education only by the application sets added to them a variety of software
